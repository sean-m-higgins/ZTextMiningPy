  This was going to be the first dynamic medium -- a means of representing, communicating, and animating thoughts, dreams, and fantasies as well as words, images, and sounds.
  He recognized the power of Engelbart's system as a toolkit for knowledge workers like editors and architects, scientists, stockbrokers, attorneys, designers, engineers, and legislators.
  Information experts desperately needed tools like NLS.
  But Kay was after a more universal, perhaps more profound power.
  One of the concepts that played a big part in Papert's LOGO project, and thus influenced Alan Kay and others, was derived from the thinking of John Dewey, whose work encouraged generations of progressive educators.
  Dewey developed a theory that Piaget later elaborated -- that the imaginative play often mistakenly judged by adults to be "aimless" is actually a potent tool for learning about the world.
  Kay wanted to link the natural desire to explore fantasies with the innate ability to learn from experimentation, and he knew that the computer's power to simulate anything that could be clearly described was one key to making that connection.
  Alan wanted to create a medium that was a fantasy amplifier as well as an intellectual augmentor.
  First he had to devise a language more suited for his purposes than LOGO, a "new kind of programming system that would attempt to combine simplicity and ease of access with a qualitative improvement in expert-level adult programming."
  With the right kind of programming language, used in conjunction with the high-powered computer hardware he foresaw for the near future, Kay thought that an entirely new kind of computer -- a personal computer -- might be possible.
