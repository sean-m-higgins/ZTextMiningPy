  The kind of language he began to yearn for would be a tool for using the computer as a kind of universal simulator.
  The problem was that programming languages were demonically esoteric.
  Or you can make something like a pencil that can be used quickly and easily for anything from learning the alphabet to drawing to writing a computer program."
  He was convinced that 99 percent of the problem to be solved in making a truly usable personal computer program were software problems: "By 1966, everyone knew where the silicon was going."
  Besides FLEX, Kay's other project at Utah was to make some software work.
  He got a pile of tape canisters on his desk, along with a note that the tapes were supposed to contain a scientific programming language known as Algol 60, but they didn't work.
  It was a maddening software puzzle that was still far from solved when Kay figured out that it wasn't Algol 60 but a language from Norway, of all places, called Simula.
  In a 1984 interview, Kay described what happened when he finally printed out on paper the program listings stored in those mysterious canisters and figured out what was on those tapes: We couldn't understand any of the papers, they were sort of transliterated from the Norwegian.
  We spread out the program listings and actually went through the machine code to try to figure out what was happening -- and I suddenly realized that Simula was a programming language to do what Sketchpad did.
  I had never really understood what Sketchpad was.
