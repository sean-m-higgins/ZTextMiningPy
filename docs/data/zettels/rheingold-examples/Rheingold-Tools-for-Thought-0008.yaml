  But what the software ancestors sought to create were tools to amplify the power of their own brains--machines to take over what they saw as the more mechanical aspects of thought.
  Perhaps as an occupational hazard of this dangerously self-reflective enterprise, or as a result of being extraordinary people in restrictive social environments, the personalities of these patriarchs (and matriarchs) of computation reveal a common streak of eccentricity, ranging from the mildly unorthodox to the downright strange.
  Charles Babbage and Ada, Countess of Lovelace, lived in the London of Dickens and Prince Albert (and knew them both).
  A hundred years before some of the best minds in the world used the resources of a nation to build a digital computer, these two eccentric inventor-mathematicians dreamed of building their "Analytical Engine."
  He constructed a partial prototype and she used it, with notorious lack of success, in a scheme to win a fortune at the horse races.
  Despite their apparent failures, Babbage was the first true computer designer, and Ada was history's first programmer.
  George Boole invented a mathematical tool for future computer-builders--an "algebra of logic" that was used nearly a hundred years later to link the process of human reason to the operations of machines.
  The idea came to him in a flash of inspiration when he was walking across a meadow one day, at the age of seventeen, but it took him twenty years to teach himself enough mathematics to write The Laws of Thought.
  Although Boole's lifework was to translate his inspiration into an algebraic system, he continued to be so impressed with the suddenness and force of the revelation that hit him that day in the meadow that he also wrote extensively about the powers of the unconscious mind.
  After his death Boole's widow turned these ideas into a kind of human potential cult, a hundred years before the "me decade."
