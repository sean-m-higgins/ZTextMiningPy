  Fifteen years since computer jockeys started having fun with it, that medium has become the commercial version known as "electronic mail."
  Taylor saw the necessity of connecting to one another those isolated research communities that Licklider had seeded and Sutherland had nurtured.
  Many of the people in related fields but different institutions knew of each other, and many more did not.
  By 1956-1966, ARPA was supporting most of the nonindustrial systems research in the country, and thus Bob Taylor and his colleagues had a more up-to-date and comprehensive picture of the state of computer research than any individual researchers.
  The people Taylor funded then undertook the planning and creation of a network of computers, located in different parts of the country, linked by common-carrier communication lines, capable of sharing resources and interacting remotely with the growing community of computer researchers.
  The people who were to build and ultimately make use of the system began to get together in person to talk about the technology needed to link resources in the manner they envisioned.
  Instead of working in isolation, a small group of leaders from the time-sharing research effort began to work in concert to design the first on-line, interactive communities.
  A truly interoperating community capable of freely sharing resources across the boundaries of individual machines or geographical locations was more difficult to bring into existence than is suggested by the simplified general idea of plugging computers together via telephone lines.
  Very serious hardware and software problems had to be solved, and the "user interface" where the person meets the machine had to be further humanized.
  Every year, starting in 1966, following a tradition established by Licklider and Sutherland, Taylor called a meeting of all the principal investigators of all his projects.
