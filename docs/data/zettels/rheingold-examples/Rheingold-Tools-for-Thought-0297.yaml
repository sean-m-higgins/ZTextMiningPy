note: |
  Now his goal is to build a "fantasy amplifier," a "dynamic tool for creative thought" that is powerful enough, small enough, easy enough to use, and inexpensive enough for every schoolkid in the world to have one.
  He has the resources and the track record to make you believe he'll do it.
  Alan Kay doesn't fit the popular image of the arrogant, antisocial hacker, the fast-lane nouveau micromillionaire, or the ivory tower computer scientist.
  He wears running shoes and corduroys.
  He has a small, meticulous moustache and short, slightly tousled dark hair.
  He's so imageless you could pass him in the halls of the places he works and not notice him, even though he's the boss.
  Which isn't to say that he's egoless or even modest.
  He loves to quote himself, and often prefaces his homilies with phrases like "Kay's number one law states .
  When I first encountered him, between his stint as director of the legendary "Learning Research Group" at Xerox PARC, and his present position as a kind of "visionary at large" for Apple, Dr. Kay and his handpicked team at Atari were working under tight secrecy, with a budget that was rumored to be somewhere between $50 million and $100 million, to produce something that nobody in the corporation ever described to anybody outside the corporation.
  But anybody who has ever talked to him, or read something he has written about his dreams, can guess the general thrust of Kay's Atari project, and the probable direction of his current work at Apple.
