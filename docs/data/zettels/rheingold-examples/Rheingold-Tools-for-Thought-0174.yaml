  Then he found the perfect metaphor in nature for the future capabilities he had foreseen during his 1957-1958 "religious conversion" to interactive computing and during those 1958-1960 minicomputer encounters that set his mind wandering through the informational ecology of the future.
  The newfound metaphor showed him how to apply his computer experience to his modest discovery about how technical thinkers spend their time.
  The idea that resulted grew into a theory so bold and immense that it would alter not only human history but human evolution, if it proved to be true.
  In 1960, in the same paper in which he talked about machines that would help formulate as well as help construct theoretical models, Licklider also set forth the concept of the kind of human-computer relationship that he was later to be instrumental in initiating: The fig tree is pollinated only by the insect Blastophaga grossorum.
  The larva of the insect lives in the ovary of the fig tree, and there it gets its food.
  The tree and the insect are thus heavily interdependent: the tree cannot reproduce without the insect; the insect cannot eat without the tree; together, they constitute not only a viable but a productive and thriving partnership.
  This cooperative "living together in intimate association, or even close union, of two dissimilar organisms" is called symbiosis.
  There are many man-machine systems.
  At present, however, there are no man-computer symbioses.
  The hope is that, in not too many years, human brains and computers will be coupled together very tightly, and that the resulting partnership will think as no human being has ever thought and process data in a way not approached by the information-handling machines we know today.
