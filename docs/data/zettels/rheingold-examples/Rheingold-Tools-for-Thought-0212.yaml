note: |
  These are the members of a subculture so foreign to most outsiders that it not only walls itself off but is walled off, in turn, by those who cannot understand it.
  The wall is built from both sides at once.
  These people deserve a description.
  In very few ways do they seem average.
  First they are all bright, so bright, in fact, that they experienced social problems even before they became interested in computers.
  Second, they are self-contained.
  Their entire social existence usually centers around one another.
  Third, all aspects of their existence reinforce one another.
  They go to school in order to learn about computers, they work at jobs in programming and computer maintenance, and they lead their social lives with hackers.
  Academically, socially, and in the world of cash, computers are the focus of their existence.
