  The cafeteria overlooks Palo Alto; you can take your tray out to the terrace and look down on the bay from the vantage of this twenty-first-century cliff dwelling.
  Off the corridors that wind around the quadrangles are office cubicles, many with their doors open.
  Inside the open cubicles, various people talk on telephones or stare at their distinctively oblong Alto screens.
  Some cubicles have plants, posters, bean-bag chairs (advertisement), stereos, bicycles.
  They all have bookshelves with rows of books and the bright blue and white binders used on the reports PARC publishes for the outside world.
  Many of the cubicle dwellers are young.
  A larger proportion of them than you might expect are women.
  It has always been a multinational-looking crowd.
  I had no problem distinguishing Taylor from the assorted scientists, engineers, professors, hackers, longhairs, and boy and girl geniuses around him.
  The few differences in style were subtle but visible, nevertheless.
