  They are only symbols for states of a process -- markers in a "doubling game."
  The list of instructions (the program) is what enables the machine to double the input number.
  The instructions, not the symbols that keep track of the way they are carried out -- the rules, not the markers -- are what make the Turing machine work.
  Universal Turing machines are primarily symbol manipulators.
  And digital computers are universal Turing machines.
  It isn't easy to think of the rules of a game as a kind of machine.
  The task is somewhat easier if you think about "mechanical processes" that are so clearly and specifically defined that a machine can perform them by referring to an instruction table.
  All universal Turing machines are functionally identical devices for following the program specified by an instruction table.
  The instruction tables can differ, and they can turn the universal Turing machine into many different kinds of machine.
  For this reason, the programs are sometimes called "virtual machines."
