  One of the early recruits was the young Norbert Wiener, who was to feature prominently in another research tributary of the mainstream of ballistic technology -- the automatic control of antiaircraft guns -- and who was later to become one of the creators of the new computer-related discipline of cybernetics.
  In the 1930s, both the Aberdeen laboratory and an associated group at the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School of Engineering obtained models of the automatic analog computer constructed by Vannevar Bush at MIT, a gigantic mechanical device known as the "differential analyzer."
  It was a marvelous aid to calculation, but it was far from being a digital computer, in either its design or its performance.
  With the aid of these machines, the work of performing ballistic calculations was somewhat relieved.
  Before World War II, the machines were still second to the main resource -- mathematics professors emeriti at the Moore School, who performed the calculations by hand, with the aid of hand-cranked mechanical calculators.
  Shades of Babbage's Cornish clergymen!
  When war broke out, it was obvious that the institutions in charge of producing ballistic calculations for several armed services needed expert help.
  It was for this reason that a mobilized mathematician, Lieutenant Herman Goldstine, reported for duty at Aberdeen in August, 1942, and was assigned the task of streamlining ballistic computations.
  He soon found the Moore School facilities inadequate, and started to expand the staff of human "computers" by adding a large number of young women recruited from the Women's Army Corps to the small cadre of elderly ex-professors.
  Goldstine's wife, Adele, herself a mathematician who was to play a prominent role in the programming of early computers (she and six other women were eventually assigned the task of programming the ENIAC), became involved with recruiting and teaching new staff members.
