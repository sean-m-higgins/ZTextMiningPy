  Von Neumann and Wiener were the dramatic co-stars of the meetings, and the differences in their personal style became part of the excited and dramatic debates that characterized the formative years of cybernetics.
  Biographer Steve Heims, in his book about the two men -- John von Neumann and Norbert Wiener -- noted the way their contrasting personae emerged at these events: Wiener and von Neumann cut rather different figures at the semiannual conferences on machine-organism parallels, and each had his own circle of admirers.
  Von Neumann was small and plump, with a large forehead and a smooth oval face.
  He spoke beautiful and lucid English, with a slight middle-European accent, and he was always carefully dressed; usually a vest, coat buttoned, handkerchief in pocket, more the banker than the scholar.
  He was seen as urbane, cosmopolitan, witty, low-key, friendly and accessible.
  He talked rapidly, and many at the Macy meetings often could not follow his careful, precise, rapid reasoning.
  Wiener was the dominant figure at the conference series, in his role as brilliant originator of ideas and enfant terrible.
  Without his scientific ideas and his enthusiasm for them, the conference series would never have come into existence, nor would it have had the momentum to continue for seven years without him.
  A short, stout man with a paunch, usually standing splay-footed, he had coarse features and a small white goatee.
  He wore thick glasses and his stubby fingers usually held a fat cigar.
