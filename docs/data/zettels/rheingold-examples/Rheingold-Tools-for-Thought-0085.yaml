  Johann von Neumann, a student of Hilbert's, was one of the stars of the formalists.
  In itself, von Neumann's metamathematical achievement was remarkable.
  His work in formalism, however, was only part of what von Neumann achieved in several disparate fields, all in the same dazzling year.
  In 1927, at the age of twenty-four, von Neumann published five papers that were instant hits in the academic world, and which still stand as monuments in three separate fields of thought.
  It was one of the most remarkable interdisciplinary triple plays in history.
  Three of his 1927 masterpieces were critical to the field of quantum physics.
  Another paper established the new field of game theory.
  The paper most directly to the future of computation was about the relationship between formal logic systems and the limits of mathematics.
  In his last 1927 paper, von Neumann demonstrated the necessity of proving that all mathematics was consistent, a critically important step toward establishing the theoretical basis for computation (although nobody yet knew that).
  This led, one year later, to a paper published by Hilbert that listed three unanswered questions about mathematics that he and von Neumann had determined to be the most important questions facing logicians and mathematics of the modern era.
