  Thus, once the directions for specific woven patterns were translated into patterns of holes punched into cards, and the cards were arranged in the proper order to present to the card reading device, the cloth patterns could be preprogrammed and the entire weaving process could be automated.
  These cards struck Babbage as the key to automated calculation.
  Here was a tangible means of controlling those frustratingly abstract "patterns of action": Babbage put the step-by-step instructions for complicated calculations into a coded series of holes punched into the sets of cards that would change the way the mill worked at each step.
  Arrange the correctly coded cards in the right way, and you've replaced a platoon of elderly Cornish gentlemen.
  Change the cards, and you replace an entire army of them.
  During his crusade to build the devices that he saw in his mind's eye but was somehow never able to materialize in wood and brass, Babbage met a woman who was to become his companion, colleague, conspirator, and defender.
  She saw immediately what Babbage intended to do with his Analytical Engine, and she helped him construct the software for it.
  Her work with Babbage and the essays she wrote about the possibilities of the engine established Augusta Ada Byron, Countess of Lovelace, as a patron saint if not a founding parent of the art and science of programming.
  Ada's father was none other than Lord Byron, the most scandalous character of his day.
  His separation from Ada's mother was one of the most widely reported domestic episodes of the era, and Ada never saw her father after she was one month old.
