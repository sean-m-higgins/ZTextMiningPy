  Reader's Digest, not an organization known for small-scale pursuits, carried the organization through the early years when computer sales crept into the hundreds of thousands.
  By the end of 1982, The Source had over 25,000 subscribers, and a growth rate of over 1000 new subscribers per month.
  Satellites and state-of-the-art computers and new software were added to accommodate up to a quarter-million subscribers.
  To those who can afford an initiation fee of $100, and a connect-time fee of $7 to $22 per hour, The Source and its newer competitor, Compuserve, offer computer owners admission to an electronic community-in-the-making.
  Besides remote computing, electronic mail, communications, telemarketing, software exchange, game playing, news gathering, bulletin board, and other services, The Source provides something called "user publishing."
  Since subscribers are billed according to how much time they spend with their computer connected to the Source host computer, it is possible to pay royalties to "information providers," based on a portion of that connect time.
  Every time a Source subscriber reads wire service information, the information provider gets a cut of the take.
  The same is true of user publishers.
  You have to pay for everything you put in storage, so the popularity of your service with the subscribers is what determines whether any publication is economically viable.
  To a creative writer, the challenge is tempting -- as long as you can keep your audience reading, the royalties will outweigh the storage charges.
