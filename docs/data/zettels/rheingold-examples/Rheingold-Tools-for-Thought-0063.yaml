note: |
  The emergence of the digital computer, based on the principles of Turing's machine, was stimulated by World War II, which was still four years in the future.
  In 1936, Claude Shannon had yet to discover that the algebra invented by George Boole to formalize logical operations was identical with the mathematics used to describe switching circuits.
  John von Neumann and his colleagues had yet to devise the concept of stored programming.
  Norbert Wiener hadn't formalized the description of feedback circuits in control systems.
  Several crucial electronic developments were yet to come.
  Although only a half-dozen metamathematicians thought about such things during the 1930s, the notion of machines whose functions depend on the descriptions of how they operate happened to have one real-world application that suddenly became very important toward the end of the decade.
  In 1940, the British government developed an intense interest in Turing's theories.
  WWII A top-secret project code-named "Ultra," under the direction of an intelligence officer code-named "Intrepid," had captured and brought to London the secret German cipher machine known as "Enigma."
  The machine enabled the Nazi high command to send orders to field commanders in the form of an uncrackable code.
  Even though they had the machine in their hands British intelligence was still baffled by the encoding mechanism.
