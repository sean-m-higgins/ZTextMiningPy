note: |
  It seemed like a natural step for Wiener, considering his prior experience in the early ballistic calculation efforts at Aberdeen during World War I.
  The key ideas that led to computers were in the air in the late 1930s, albeit in the rather rarefied air of metamathematics and other esoteric intellectual disciplines.
  The necessities of war and the coordinated scientific effort that they entailed served to bring those key ideas together with the few people who were equipped to understand them more quickly and urgently than might have happened in more normal times.
  Von Neumann and Goldstine's accidental meeting at Aberdeen was fortuitous and unlikely, but it could hardly be called incredible.
  One of the circumstances that brought Wiener together with the problem of antiaircraft guns, however, was downright weird.
  The technological turning point of the Battle of Britain, and a critical chapter in the science of communications systems in machines and organisms, originated when a young Bell Laboratories employee in America had an odd dream.
  The crucial dream was not about mathematics or engineering problems connected with computers, but was related to technical issues involving antiaircraft artillery.
  And it was the question of how to deal with dive bombers that was the rather urgent if indirect problem that led to Wiener's later insights.
  The pathway between military strategy and scientific theory was far too circuitous, coincidental, and unlikely to have been predicted in advance, and became clearly discernible only in retrospect.
  In many respects, the birth of cybernetics was the kind of story more likely to be found in a novel than in a scientific journal.
