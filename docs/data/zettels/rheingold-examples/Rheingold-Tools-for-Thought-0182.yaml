  The size, speed, cost, and energy requirements of the basic switching elements of computers changed by orders of magnitude when electron tubes replaced relays in the late 1940s, and again when transistors replaced tubes in the 1950s, and now integrated circuits were about to replace transistors in the 1960s.
  In the blue-sly labs, where the engineers were almost outnumbered by the dreamers, they were even talking about "large-scale integration."
  When basic science makes breakthroughs at such a pace, and when technological exploitation of those discoveries is so deliberately intensified, a big problem is being able to envision what's possible and preferable to do next.
  The ability to see a long range goal, and to encourage the right combination of boldness and pragmatism in all the subfields that could contribute to achieving it, was the particular talent that Licklider brought onto the scene.
  And with Licklider came a new generation of designers and engineers who had their sights on something the pre-Sputnik computer orthodoxy would have dismissed as science fiction.
  Suddenly, human-computer symbiosis wasn't an esoteric hypothesis in a technical journal, but a national goal.
  When Licklider went to ARPA, he wasn't given a laboratory, but an office, a budget, and a mandate to raise the state of the art of information processing.
  He started by supporting thirteen different research groups around the country, primarily at MIT; System Development Corporation (SDC); the University of California at Berkeley, Santa Barbara, and Los Angeles; USC; Rand; Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International); Carnagie-Mellon University; and the university of Utah.
  And when his office decided to support a project, that meant providing thirty or forty times the budget that the researchers were accustomed to, along with access to state-of-the-art research technology and a mandate to think big and think fast.
  A broad range of new capabilities that Licklider then called "interactive computing" was the ultimate goal, and the first step was an exciting new concept that came to be known as time-sharing.
