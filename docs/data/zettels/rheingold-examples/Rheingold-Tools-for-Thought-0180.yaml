  But there was an idea floating around Lincoln that SAGE-like displays might be adapted to many kinds of computers, not just the big ones used to monitor air defenses.
  By 1961, the psychology of graphic displays had become something of a specialty for Licklider.
  Between BB&N and Lincoln, he was spending more time with electrical engineers than with psychologists.
  Through his computer-oriented colleagues, Licklider became acquainted with Jack Ruina, director of ARPA in the early 1960s.
  Ruina wanted to do something about computerizing military command and control systems on all levels -- not just air defense -- and wanted to set up a special office within ARPA to develop new information processing techniques.
  ARPA's goal was to leapfrog over conventional research and development by funding attempts to make fundamental breakthroughs.
  And Licklider's notion of creating a new kind of computer capable of directly interacting with human operators via a keyboard and a display screen interface (instead of relying on batch processing or even paper-tape input) convinced Ruina that the minority of computer researchers Licklider was talking about might just lead to such a possible breakthrough.
  And that event, as much as any other development of that era, marked the beginning of the age of personal computing.
  The unprecedented technological revolution that began with the post-Sputnik mobilization and reached a climax with Neil Armstrong's first step on the moon a little more than a decade later was in a very large part made possible by a parallel revolution in the way computers were used.
  The most spectacular visual shows of the space age were provided by the enormous rockets.
