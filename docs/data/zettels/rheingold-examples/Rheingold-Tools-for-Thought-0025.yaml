  The four subassemblies of the Analytical Engine functioned very much like analogous units in modern computing machinery.
  The mill was the analog of the central processing unit of a digital computer and the store was the memory device.
  Twentieth-century programmers would recognize the printer as a standard output device.
  It was the input device and the control unit, however, that made it possible to move beyond calculation toward true computation.
  The input portion of the Analytical Engine was an important milestone in the history of programming.
  Babbage borrowed the idea of punched-card programming from the French inventor Jacquard, who had triggered a revolution on the textile industry by inventing a mechanical method of weaving patterns in cloth.
  The weaving machines used arrays of metal rods to automatically pull threads into position.
  To create patterns, Jacquard's device interposed a stiff card, with holes punched in it, between the rods and the threads.
  The card was designed to block some of the rods from reaching the thread on each pass; the holes in the card allowed only certain rods to carry threads into the loom.
  Each time the shuttle was thrown, a new card would appear in the path of the rods.
