note: |
  He has been moving toward realizing his dream, project by project, prototype by prototype, innovation by innovation, ever since he was a graduate student.
  Being the kind of person he is didn't make it easy for Alan to get an education.
  At the beginning, he knew more than all of his classmates and most of his teachers, and he didn't mind demonstrating it aloud -- a trait that got him thrown out of classrooms and beaten up on playgrounds.
  Fortunately for him and for all of us who may benefit from his creations in the future, Alan was already well armored in his mind and imagination, where it really counted, by the time his teachers and classmates got ahold of him.
  For Alan, being ahead of everybody else started out as a pleasure and quickly turned into a survival trait -- which meant he didn't do too well in school, or anyplace else, until the summer of his fifteenth year, when "a music camp in Oneonta, New York, changed my entire life."
  Music became the center of his life.
  In many ways, it still is.
  He commutes to Silicon Valley from his home in Brentwood, 300 miles away, mostly because he doesn't want to be away from his homemade pipe organ for too long.
  And he still goes to music camp every summer.
  He never understood why his two favorite toys -- books and musical instruments -- could not be combined into a single medium capable of dealing with both sounds and symbols.
