  The kind of uses the inventors envisioned for the future of their technology was a cause for one of several major theoretical disagreements that were to surface soon thereafter among the four ENIAC principals.
  Von Neumann and Goldstine saw the opportunity to build an incredibly powerful research tool for scientists and mathematicians.
  Mauchly and Eckert were already thinking of business and government applications outside military or research institutions.
  The first calculation run on ENIAC in December, 1945, six months after the "First Draft," was a problem posed by scientists from Los Alamos Laboratories.
  ENIAC was formally dedicated in February, 1946.
  By then, the patriotic solidarity enforced upon the research team by wartime conditions had faded away.
  Von Neumann was enthusiastic about the military and scientific future of the computer-building enterprise, but the two young men who had dreamed up the computer project before the big brass stepped in were getting other ideas about how their brain-child ought to mature.
  The tensions between institutions, people, and ideas mounted until Mauchly and Eckert left the Moore School on March 31, 1946, over a dispute with the university concerning patent rights to ENIAC.
  They founded their own group shortly thereafter, eventually naming it The Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation.
  When Mauchly and Eckert later suggested that they were, in fact, the sole originators of the EDVAC report, they were, in Goldstine's phrase, "strenuously opposed" by Goldstine and von Neumann.
