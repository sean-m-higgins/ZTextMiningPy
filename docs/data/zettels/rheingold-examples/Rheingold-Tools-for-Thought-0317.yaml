  It was precisely the kind of environment in which a true personal computer might move from dream to design stage.
  Alan Kay was already thinking about a special kind of very powerful and portable personal computer that he later came to call "the Dynabook."
  Everybody, from the programmers in the "software factory" who designed the software operating system and programming tools, to the hardware engineers of the Alto prototype machines, to the Ethernet local-area-network team who worked to link the units, was motivated by the burning desire to get a working personal computer in their own hands as soon as possible.
  In 1971, Alan wrote and thought about something that wasn't yet called a Dynabook but looked very much like it.
  Kay's Learning Research Group, including Adele Goldberg, Dan Ingalls, and others, began to create Smalltalk, the programming "environment" that would breathe computational life into the hardware, once the hardware wizards downstairs cooked up a small network of prototype personal computers.
  One of the most important features of the anticipated hardware was the visual resolution of the display screen.
  One of the things Alan had noticed when watching children learn LOGO was that kids are very demanding computer users, especially in terms of having a high-resolution, colorful, dynamic display.
  They were accustomed to cartoons on television and 70-mm wide-screen movies, not the fuzzy images then to be found on computer displays.
  Kay and his colleagues knew that hardware breakthroughs of the near future would make it possible to combine the interactive properties of a graphical language like Sketchpad with very high-resolution images.
  The amount of image resolution possible on a video display screen depends on how many picture elements are represented on the screen.
