  Instead of encountering an asterisk and looking at the bottom of the page for a footnote, and possibly looking up another document elsewhere in the library to verify a reference, the user would point a lightpen or a mouse as the electronic equivalent of the asterisk, and automatically bring the appended or referenced material to the screen.
  A return button would bring the user back to the point in the original text where the link symbol appeared.
  A very similar feature was built into Doug Engelbart's early NLS system.
  Engelbart was more concerned with constructing the toolkit and workshop for solving problems than speculating about the kind of literary form such a facility might create.
  Nelson, however, being a liberal arts type rather than an engineering type -- a dichotomy he deplores, since it kept him away from computers for so long -- wondered what art forms and intellectual systems might emerge.
  In its simplest essence, a link is a reminder that "there is something to jump to here."
  Links meant that literature no longer had to be sequential.
  The link facility, Nelson insisted from the first, provides something far more powerful than a means of attaching odds and ends.
  A system with backtrack, versioning, and links would create the possibility of a new way of organizing thoughts into words, a nonsequential form of writing that was never possible before computers, a literary form he called hypertext.
  Hypertext, as he first imagined it, could apply to scholarship as well as to poetry.
