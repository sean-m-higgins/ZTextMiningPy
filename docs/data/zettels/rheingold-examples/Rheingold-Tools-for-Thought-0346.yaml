  Games and creating art, for example.
  So what is it that a computer does, in that case?
  My answer is that its function is to represent things.
  Which, in the case of art or games, means that the function is at least the same as the outcome, because in art or games, representation is at least part of the outcome."
  Kids don't play video games by the hour because it is a good way to practice hand-eye coordination, or for any other reason besides the sheer pleasure of playing.
  On the other hand, nobody uses a word processing program out of sheer enjoyment of using the program; they use a word processor because they want to write something.
  In the case of the word processor, the outcome is most important.
  In the video game, there is no separation from the user/player and the world represented in the game.
  In the word processor, the command language of the software creates a distance between the user and the task.
