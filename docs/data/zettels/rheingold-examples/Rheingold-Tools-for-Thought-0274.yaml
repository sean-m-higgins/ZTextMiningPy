  The authors emphasized that the melding of communication and computation technologies could raise the nature of human communication to a new level.
  They proposed that the ability to share information among the members of a community and the presence of significant computational power in the hands of individuals were equal components of a new communicating and thinking environment they envisioned for the intermediate future.
  The implications were profound, they felt, and not entirely foreseeable: "when minds interact, new ideas emerge," they wrote.
  The authors did not begin the article by talking about the capabilities of computers; instead, they examined the human function they wished to amplify, specifically the function of group decision-making and problem-solving.
  They urged that the tool to accomplish such amplification should be built according to the special requirements of that human function.
  In order to use computers as communication amplifiers for groups of people, a new communication medium was needed: "Creative, interactive communication requires a plastic or moldable medium that can be modeled, a dynamic medium in which premises will flow into consequences, and above all a common medium that can be contributed to and experimented with by all."
  The need for a plastic, dynamic medium, and the requirement that it be accessible to all, grew out of the authors' belief that the construction and comparison of informational models are central to human communication.
  Collections of facts, memories, perceptions, images, associations, predictions, and prejudices are the ingredients in our mental models, and in that sense, mental models are as individual as the people who formulate them.
  The essential privacy and variability of the models we construct in our heads create the need to make external versions that can be perceived and agreed upon by others.
  Because society, a collective entity, distrusts the modeling done by only one mind, it insists that people agree about models before the models can be accepted as fact.
