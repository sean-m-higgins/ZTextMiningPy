  A computer-directed videodisk connects the video steering controls to a very large collection of photographs of Aspen.
  The computer translates your position and your commands into the correct sequence of photographs.
  If you decide to look to the left, the screen shows the streets and houses that are located to the left of this position in the real city.
  If you decide to stop and take a closer look at one of the houses that are specially marked, or even open the door and look inside, you can do so.
  The kind of simple branching structure of a city's streets represents only the most basic kind of information base that can be represented spatially.
  The most important aspect of this idea doesn't have to do with road maps -- although this is obviously a good way to learn how to get around in a town you've never seen before.
  The important point is that some information domains can be organized around a spatial metaphor, creating a coherent environment path that each user can move around in by following his own particular path.
  A reference work for someone trying to find the problem in an automobile engine or the plumbing system of a nuclear submarine could just as easily be mapped in such a way.
  Whether they came from MIT, Carnagie-Mellon, or another video game manufacturer, every person in Kay's Atari group represented the cream of the crop of the best young minds in fields ranging from robotics to holography to videodisk technology to artificial intelligence to cognitive psychology to software design.
  The necessary hardware components of the media room will become available, everyone hopes, by the time the really tricky part -- the software design, construction, and debugging -- is on its way to completion.
