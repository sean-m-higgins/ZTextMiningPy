note: |
  The text-editing system was the first stage of Doug's long-term plan.
  The actual use of the system to design and describe the next generation was the second stage.
  Both stages were accomplished by 1968.
  Even as early as 1968, NLS was not limited to what we now call a word processing system.
  The third-stage goal was to build an entire toolkit for intellectual tasks, and develop the procedures and methods by which those tools could be used, individually and collectively, to boost the performance of people who did information-related work.
  The toolkit would then be used to develop new modes of computer-aided human collaboration.
  Software was created to connect the text-editing system with a special kind of electronic filing arrangement that would serve as a unifying memory, record, and medium for their individual efforts.
  The software journal through which individuals and groups could have access to a shared thinking and communicating space had been in development since 1965-1966; it enabled individuals to insert comments into the group record of the augmentation experiments (or browse through them), and enabled programmers to trace the way system features had evolved.
  The journal, along with shared screen telephoning to enhance real-time, one-to-one communications, was part of the overall dialogue support system designed to help increase effectiveness of group communication and decision making.
  The idea of the journal predated the development of computer networks and teleconferencing, originating as it did with a dozen terminals connected to a single multiaccess computer.
