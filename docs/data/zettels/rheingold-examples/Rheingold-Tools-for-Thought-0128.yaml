  And again I said, "I have no idea, but there is one question that I would like to answer: What is a number that man may know it, and a man that he may know a number?"
  He smiled and said, "Friend, thee will be busy as long as thee lives."
  Accordingly, the mathematician in McCulloch strongly desired a tool for reducing the fuzzy observations and theoretical uncertainties of neurophysiology to the clean-cut precision of mathematics.
  Turing, and Bertrand Russell before him, and Boole before that, had been after something roughly similar, but they all lacked a deep understanding of brain physiology.
  McCulloch's goal was to find a basic functional unit of the brain, consisting of some combination of nerve cells, and to discover how that basic unit was built into a system of greater complexity.
  He had been experimenting with models of "nerve networks" and had discovered that these networks had certain mathematical and logical properties.
  McCulloch started to work with a young logician by the name of Walter Pitts.
  Pamela McCorduck, a historian of artificial intelligence research, attributes to Manuel Blum, a student of McCulloch's and now a professor at the University of California, the story of Pitt's arrival on the cybernetic scene.
  At the age of fifteen, Walter Pitts ran away from home when his father wanted him to quit school and get a job.
  He arrived in Chicago, and met a man who knew a little about logic.
