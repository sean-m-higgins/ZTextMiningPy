  There would be rough spots, software and interpersonal bugs, arguments and conflicts, to be sure -- but the master plan was progressing nicely, considering all those years he had worked alone.
  The toolkit had become a workshop, and they knew the workshop indeed worked because they had been their own guinea pigs for a decade.
  In the same 1970 address in which he referred to the multiaccess computing community as a "meeting of suppliers looking at the prospector trade," Engelbart also predicted that the future would see "a steadily increasing number of people who spend a significant amount of their professional time at terminals," and speculated that the future of dispersed personal augmentation systems linked together into network communities would create new kinds of societal institutions: "In particular, there will emerge a new 'marketplace,' representing fantastic wealth in commodities of knowledge, service, information, processing, storage, etc."
  In his usual forge-ahead manner, Engelbart was already bringing members of the business community into the ARC experiment.
  Business managers and management scientists had been working at ARC, experimenting with using NLS tools to manage the steadily growing ARC project.
  In proper bootstrapping style, they looked at their attempts to apply the system to their own research management as yet another experiment.
  Richard Watson and James C. Norton worked closely with ARC to develop their experimental discoveries into a system that would be usable by people who were not computer experts but whose occupations involved the manipulation of information.
  Sometime in the early 1970s, Engelbart was inspired by a book, just as he had been enthused by magazine articles by Bush and Licklider in years past.
  This time, it was the theory proposed by business management expert Peter Drucker in the late 1960s.
  Knowledge, by Drucker's definition, is the systematic organization of information; a knowledge worker is a person who creates and applies knowledge to productive ends.
