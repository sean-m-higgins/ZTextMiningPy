  First, the human has to learn how to communicate with the computer; then he or she needs to know how the system arrived at its conclusion, in terms that he or she can understand.
  And in order to tell the human about the steps of its reasoning process, such systems must have a means for knowing what they know.
  By this point, the exercise has become more than a mechanical search through long lists of possibilities.
  Problem-solving is only part of the function of a system that must convince a human that a solution it has found is indeed the correct one.
  The internal and external communication aspects of this transfer process, Barr suspects, offer clues to some of the most significant problems in artificial intelligence as well as intellectual augmentation research: We are building systems that take part in the human activity of transfer of expertise among experts, practitioners, and students in different kinds of domains.
  Our problems remain the same as they were before: We must find good ways to represent knowledge and metaknowledge, to carry on a dialogue, and to solve problems in the domain.
  But the guiding principles of our approach and the underlying constraints on our solutions have been subtly shifted: Our systems are no longer being designed solely to be expert problem solvers, using vast amounts of encoded knowledge.
  These are aspects of "knowing" that have so far remained unexplored in AI research: By participation in human transfer of expertise, these systems will involve more of the fabric of behavior that is the reason we ascribe knowledge and intelligence to people.
  Like Doug Engelbart and Alan Kay, Barr feels that future generations will be less inhibited than present-day computer builders and users when it comes to stretching our ideas of what machines and humans can do.
  This adjustment of human attitudes and computer capabilities is a present-day pragmatic concern of knowledge engineers, and a long-term prerequisite for the kind of human-machine symbiosis predicted by Licklider.
