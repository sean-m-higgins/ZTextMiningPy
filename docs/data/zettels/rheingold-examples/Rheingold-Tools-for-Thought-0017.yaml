  Avron Barr believes that they will evolve into more than expensive encyclopedias for specialists.
  In his mid-thirties and just starting his career in an infant technology, he dreams of creating an expert assistant in the art of helping people agree with one another.
  Brenda Laurel, also in her mid-thirties, is an artist whose medium exists at the boundary of Kay's and Barr's and Engelbart's specialties.
  Her goal is to design new methods of play, learning, and artistic expression into computer-based technologies.
  Like Barr, she believes that the applications of her research point toward more extensive social effects than just another success in the software market.
  Brenda wants to use an expert system that knows what playwrights, composers, librarians, animators, artists, and dramatic critics know, to create a world of sights and sounds in which people can learn about flying a spaceship or surviving in the desert or being a blue whale by experiencing space-desert-whale simulated microworlds in person.
  Ted Nelson is a dropout, gadfly, and self-proclaimed genius who self-published Computer Lib, the best-selling underground manifesto of the microcomputer revolution.
  His dream of a new kind of publishing medium and continuously updated world-library threatens to become the world's longest software project.
  He's wild and woolly, imaginative and hyperactive, has problems holding jobs and getting along with colleagues, and was the secret inspiration to all those sub-teenage kids who lashed together homebrew computers or homemade programs a few years back and are now the ruling moguls of the microcomputer industry.
  Time will tell whether he is a prophet too far ahead of his time, or just a persistent crackpot, but there is no doubt that he has contributed a rare touch of humor to the often too-serious world of computing.
