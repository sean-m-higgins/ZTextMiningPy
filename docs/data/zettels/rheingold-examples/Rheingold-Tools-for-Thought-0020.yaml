note: |
  He was the first to propose that the weather of past years could be discovered by observing cycles of tree rings.
  And he was passionate about more than a few crackpot ideas that history has since proved to be nothing more than crackpot ideas.
  His human relationships were as erratic as his intellectual adventures, to judge from the number of lifelong public feuds Babbage was known to have engaged in.
  Along with his running battles with the Royal Societies, Babbage carried on a long polemic against organ-grinders and street musicians.
  Babbage would write letters to editors about street noise, and half the organ-grinders in London took to serenading under Babbage's window when they were in their cups.
  One biographer, B. V. Bowden, noted that "It was the tragedy of the man that, although his imagination and vision were unbounded, his judgment by no means matched them, and his impatience made him intolerant of those who failed to sympathize with his projects."
  Babbage dabbled in half a dozen sciences and traveled with a portable laboratory.
  He was also a supreme nit-picker, sharp-eyed and cranky, known to write outraged letters to publishers of mathematical tables, upbraiding them for obscure inaccuracies he had uncovered in the pursuit of his own calculations.
  A mistake in navigational table, after all, was a matter of life and death for a seafarer.
  And a mistake in a table of logarithms could seriously impede the work of a great mind such as his own.
