  In front of him was the display screen.
  The large screen behind him could alternate, or share, multiple views of Doug's hands, his face, the information on the display screen, and images of his colleagues and their display screens at Menlo Park.
  The screen could be divided into a number of "windows," each of which could display either text or image.
  The changing information displayed on the large screen, activated by his fingertip commands on the five-key device and his motions of the mouse, began to animate under Doug's control.
  Everyone in the room had attended hundreds of slide presentations before this, but from the moment Doug first imparted movement to the views on the screen, it became evident that this was like no audiovisual presentation anyone had attempted before.
  Engelbart was the very image of a test pilot for a new kind of vehicle that doesn't fly over geographical territory but through what was heretofore an abstraction that computer scientists call "information space."
  He not only looked the part, but acted it: The Chuck Yeager of the computer cosmos, calmly putting the new system through its paces and reporting back to his astonished earthbound audience in a calm, quiet voice.
  Imagine that you are in a new kind of vehicle with virtually unlimited range in both space and time.
  In this vehicle is a magic window that enables you to choose from a very large range of possible views and to rapidly filter a vast field of possibilities -- from the microscopic to the galactic, from a certain word in a certain book in a certain library, to a summary of the entire field of knowledge.
  The territory you see through the augmented window in your new vehicle is not the normal landscape of plains and trees and oceans, but an informationscape in which the features are words, numbers, graphs, images, concepts, paragraphs, arguments, relationships, formulas, diagrams, proofs, bodies of literature and schools of criticism.
