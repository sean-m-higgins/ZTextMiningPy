  The way the task was accomplished by living organisms of the type found on earth was only one way it could be done.
  In principle, the task could be done by a machine that could follow a plan, because the plan, and not the mechanism that carried it out, was a part of the system with the special, heretofore mysterious property that distinguished life from nonliving matter.
  Von Neumann approached "cellular automata" on an abstract level, just as Turing did with his first machines.
  As early as 1948, he showed that any self-replicating system must have raw materials, a program that provides instructions, an automaton that follows the instructions and arranges the symbols in the cells of a Turing-type machine, a system for duplicating instructions, and a supervisory unit -- which turned out to be an excellent description of the DNA direction of protein synthesis in living cells.
  Another thing that interested Johnny was the gamelike aspect of the world.
  Accordingly, he thought about the way his self-reproducing automaton was like a game: Making use of the work done by his colleague Stanislav Ulam, von Neumann was able to refine his calculations and make them more generally applicable.
  Von Neumann's mental experiment, which we can easily present in the form of a game, makes use of a homogeneous space subdivided by cells.
  We can think of these cells as squares on a playing board.
  A finite number of states -- e.g., empty, occupied, or occupied by a specific color -- is assigned to a square.
  At the same time, a neighborhood is defined for each cell.
