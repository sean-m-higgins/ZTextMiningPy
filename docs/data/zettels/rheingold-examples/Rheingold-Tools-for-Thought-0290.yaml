  As it happened, April, 1981, when the Star 8010 Information System was announced, was still too early for the larger segments of office professionals to realize that they were information workers.
  Xerox marketing management insisted that the workstation was not only a breakthrough in providing tools for individuals, but a part of an integrated office system of interconnected components that shared mail, printing, and filing services.
  But nobody outside a few privileged test sites knew what that meant.
  Until word processing came out of nowhere (as far as the people in offices were concerned) to replace most of the typing pools in the early 1980s, it wasn't clear to the people who bought office equipment for corporations that computers and office workers were bound to get acquainted rapidly.
  To the first knowledge workers at aerospace firms, it was very clear that there was a major difference between these machines and the devices they had formerly known as computers.
  The place where the mind meets the machine, the long-neglected frontier of computer development, was advanced to a new high level by those at ARC and PARC who created the partially psychological, partially computational engineering of the user interface.
  The dreams of the augmentation pioneers were finally materialized in the products of their students, who took the first steps with the Star to engineer the machine to the minds of the potential users.
  The Star designers reiterated the connection between sophisticated visual representation and the ability to amplify thought: During conscious thought, the brain utilizes several levels of memory, the most important being the "short-term memory."
  Many studies have analyzed the short-term memory and its role in thinking.
  Two conclusions stand out.
