  They are: Replace O with X.
  Replace X with O.
  Go one square to the right.
  Go one square to the left.An example of an instruction is: "If there is an X on the active square replace it with O."
  This instruction causes the machine to perform the second action listed above.
  In order to create a "game," we need to make a list that specifies the number of the instruction that is being followed at every step as well as the number of the instruction that is to be followed next.
  That is like saying "The machine is now following (for example) instruction seven, and the instruction to be followed next is (for example) instruction eight."
  Here is a series of instructions, given in coded form and the more English-like translation.
  Taken together, these instructions constitute an "instruction table" or a "program" that tells a Turing machine how to play a certain kind off game: 1X02 (Instruction #1: if an X is on the active square, replace it with O, then execute instruction #2.)
  Note that if there is an O on the active square in instruction #1 or #7, or if there is an X on the active square in instruction #2, the machine will stop.
