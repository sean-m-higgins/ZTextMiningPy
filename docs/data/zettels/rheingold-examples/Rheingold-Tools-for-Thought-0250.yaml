  Distribution lists can be members of distribution lists -- you can designate a list to be the recipient of an announcement, and every member of the designated list will receive your message.
  Messages and articles can contain lists of citations, and catalogs and indices can be message forms of their own.
  Ideas and hypotheses could be conveyed by telling interested members of the community to read a certain list of cited articles in a particular order.
  This more formal and highly structured kind of intellectual discourse is essential to science, but is not the usual mode of communication used in the day-to-day affairs of ordinary citizens.
  As Licklider and Taylor, Doug's long-time colleagues and principal funders, pointed out in 1968, the new interactive computers and new intercomputer networks would make it possible to use tools like NLS to construct a computer-aided community in which not only intellect but communication could be augmented.
  At the most fundamental level, communication begins when two or more people need to share information, transact business, make decisions, resolve differences, reach agreements, solve problems, communicate plans.
  One of the early creations in the NLS collection of software levers and pulleys and skyhooks brought the other capabilities of the system to bear on communications.
  ARC developed a "mode of teleconferencing" whereby: .
  When simultaneously talking on the telephone the resulting dialogue can be uniquely effective -- corresponding to an in-person conference around a collective assemblage of their scratch pads, working records, and individual support facilities.
  But consider the great potential already existing when some of the participants -- or even a single participant -- can effectively use computer tools to work with the relevant materials and processes.
