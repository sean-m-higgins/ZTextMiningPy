  Turing was a tragic victim of political events before he could get his hands on a computer worth the name.
  Johnny, however, not only managed to get his machines built and use them to create the first working principles of software -- but he also ended up telling his government how to use the new technology.
  He was responsible for much more than the first boost in accelerating American effort to develop computer technology.
  A combination of many different scientific and political developments led to the invention of ENIAC.
  Electronic tube technology, Boolean logic, Turing-type computation, Babbage-Lovelace programming, and feedback-control theories were brought together because of the War Department's insatiable hunger for raw calculating power.
  John von Neumann was the only man who not only knew enough about the scientific issues but moved comfortably enough in the societies of Princeton and Los Alamos and Washington to grasp the threads and weave them together in an elegant and powerful design.
  Von Neumann was a very important, probably indispensable, member of the Manhattan Project scientific team.
  Oppenheimer, Fermi, Teller, Bohr, Lawrence, and the other members of the most gifted scientific gathering of minds in history were as awed by Johnny's intellect as anyone else who ever met him.
  More impressively, they were as reliant on his mathematical judgment as anyone else.
  In that galactic cluster of world-class physicists, chemists, mathematicians, and engineers, it was a rare tribute that von Neumann was put in charge of the mathematical calculations upon which all their theories -- and the functioning of their "gadget" -- would depend.
