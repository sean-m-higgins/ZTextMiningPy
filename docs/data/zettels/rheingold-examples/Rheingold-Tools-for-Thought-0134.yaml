  Wiener intended to embed in the name of the discipline the idea that there is a connection between steering and communication.
  The mathematics underlying the steering of rudders or antiaircraft guns and the steering of biological systems was the same -- it was a general law, Wiener felt, like the laws of motion or gravity.
  Wiener's intuitions turned out to be correct.
  Communication and control, coding and decoding, steering and predicting, were becoming more important to physicists and biologists, who were interested in phenomena very different from guns or computing machines.
  In the late 1940s, another new category of interdisciplinary theorists who would come to be known as molecular biologists were beginning to think about the coding mechanism of genetics.
  Even the quantum physicists were looking into the issues that were so dear to Wiener, Bigelow, and Rosenblueth.
  It looked as if Wiener might be onto an even more cosmic link between information, energy, and matter.
  A scientific watershed was imminent, and many of his colleagues were expecting more major breakthroughs from Wiener.
  By the fall of 1947, prior to its 1948 publication, his book on cybernetics was making the rounds of government and academic experts in manuscript form.
  Robert Fano, a professor of electrical engineering who eventually became head of the electrical engineering department at MIT and administrative leader of MIT's pioneering computer project known as MAC, witnessed some strange behavior on Wiener's part around that time, behavior that Fano later had cause to remember when Claude Shannon published his work.
