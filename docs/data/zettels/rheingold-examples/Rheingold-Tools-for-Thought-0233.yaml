  They were particularly interested in the same paper of Doug's that the mainstream of computer science had chosen to ignore.
  The paper that attracted the attention of ARPA and met such a thundering silence from the wider community of computer theorists in 1963 was entitled "A Conceptual Framework for the Augmentation of Man's Intellect."
  In its introduction, Engelbart presented the manifesto by which he meant to launch an entire new field of human knowledge: By "augmenting man's intellect" we mean increasing the capability of a man to approach a complex problem situation, gain comprehension to suit his particular needs, and to derive solutions to problems.
  Increased capability in this respect is taken to mean a mixture of the following: that comprehension can be gained more quickly; that better comprehension can be gained; that a useful degree of comprehension can be gained where previously the situation was too complex; that solutions can be produced more quickly; that better solutions can be produced; that solutions can be found where previously the human could find none.
  And by "complex situations" we include the professional problems of diplomats, executives, social scientists, life scientists, attorneys, designers -- whether the problem situation exists for twenty minutes or twenty years.
  We do not speak of isolated clever tricks that help in particular situations.
  We refer to a way of life in an integrated domain where hunches, cut-and-try, intangibles, and the human "feel for a situation" usefully coexist with powerful concepts, streamlined technology and notation, sophisticated methods, and high-powered electronic aids.
  It was no accident that "hunches, cut-and-try, intangibles," were listed early and "high-powered electronic aids" was listed last.
  Although he knew that widespread access to digital computers was the only means by which our society could make use of an augmented knowledge system, Engelbart also understood that the hardware was a low-level component of the total system he meant to augment.
  Human intellect uses tools, but the power of the human mind is not itself limited to the tools the human brain automatically provides.
