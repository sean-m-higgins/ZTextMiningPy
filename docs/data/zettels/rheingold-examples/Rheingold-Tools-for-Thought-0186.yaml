  In a way, this was a dramatic answer to Licklider's quest for a fast model-builder.
  But Sketchpad was much more than a tool for creating visual displays.
  It was a kind of simulation language that enabled computers to translate abstractions into perceptually concrete forms.
  And it was a model for totally new ways of operating computers; by changing something on the display screen, it was possible, via Sketchpad, to change something in the computer's memory.
  Not only was the technical theory bold, innovative, and sound, but the program actually worked.
  With a lightpen, a keyboard, a display screen, and the Sketchpad program running on the relatively crude real-time computers available in 1962, anyone could see for themselves that computers could be used for something else beside data processing.
  And in the case of Sketchpad, seeing was truly believing.
  When he left ARPA in 1964, Licklider recommended Sutherland as the next director of the IPTO.
  By that time, Sutherland, still in his early twenties, had established a track record for himself doing what ARPA liked best -- racing ahead of the technology to accomplish what the orthodoxy considered impossible or failed to consider altogether.
  When Sutherland took over, the various time-sharing, graphics, AI, operating systems, and programming language projects were getting into full swing, and the office was growing almost as fast as the industries that were spinning off the space-age research bonanza.
