  The first thing Taylor went after, once the time-sharing project was on its way to completion, was a way of interconnecting the time-sharing communities.
  He had a privileged overview of the then-fragmented computer research world, since a good deal of his time was spent traveling to universities and think tanks, finding and funding researchers.
  Progress in the separate subfields of computer research was accelerating through the early 1960s.
  By 1966, the time was approaching when the pieces of the puzzle would be ready for assembly, and the separated teams would have to be in close communication.
  The ability to have files and resources within a time-sharing system was one difficult problem to be solved.
  On the way to solving it, people discovered a new way of communicating with each other -- something that was unexpected and became a unique medium in the research community."
