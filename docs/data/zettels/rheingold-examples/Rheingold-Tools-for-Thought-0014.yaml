  Licklider saw the new breed of interactive computers his project directors were creating as the first step toward an entirely new kind of human communication capability.
  Doug Engelbart started thinking about building a thought-amplifying device back when Harry Truman was President, and he has spent the last thirty years stubbornly pursuing his original vision of building a system for augmenting human intellect.
  At one point in the late 1960s, Engelbart and his crew of infonauts demonstrated to the assembled cream of computer scientists and engineers how the devices most people then used for performing calculations or keeping track of statistics could be used to enhance the most creative human activities.
  His former students have gone on to form a disproportionate part of the upper echelons of today's personal computer designers.
  Partially because of the myopia of his contemporaries, and partially because of his almost obsessive insistence on maintaining the purity of his original vision, most of Engelbart's innovations have yet to be adapted by the computer orthodoxy.
  Robert Taylor, at the age of thirty-three, became the director of the ARPA office created by Licklider, thus launching his career in a new and much-needed field--the shaping of large-scale, long term, human-computer research campaigns.
  He became a "people collector," looking for those computer researchers whose ideas might have been ignored by the orthodoxy, but whose projects promised to boost the state of computer systems by orders of magnitude.
  Alan Kay was one of television's original quiz kids.
  He learned to read at the age of two and a half, barely managed to avoid being thrown out of school and the Air Force, and ended up as a graduate student at one of the most important centers of ARPA research.
  In the 1970s, Kay was one of the guiding software spirits of PARC's Alto project (the first true personal computer) and the chief architect of Smalltalk, a new kind of computer language.
