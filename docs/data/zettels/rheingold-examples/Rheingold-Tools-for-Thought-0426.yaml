  Even so, they are taking over the management of our civilization.
  Before we begin to give more decision-making responsibility over to the machines, Weizenbaum warns that it is a terrible mistake to believe that all human problems and all important aspects of human life are computable.
  This "tyranny of instrumental reasoning" can lead to atrocities, Weizenbaum warns, and in the closing years of the twentieth century, it is not at all paranoid to have some healthy suspicions about what any shiny new technology that came from the Defense Department in the first place might do to our lives when they get around to mass producing it.
  And there is no dispute that war was the original motivation and has been the continuing source of support for the development of computer technology.
  If it is true that the human brain probably started out as a rock-throwing variation on the standard hominid model, it has also proved capable of creating the Sermon on the Mount, the Mona Lisa, and The Art of the Fugue.
  If it is true that the personal computer started out as an aid to ballistic calculations, it is also true that a population equipped with low-cost, high-power computers and access to self-organizing distributed networks has in its hands a potentially powerful defense against any centrally organized technological tyranny.
  Licklider believed that a human-computer symbiosis would be the means of steering our planet through the dangerous decades ahead.
  Others have used another biological metaphor for our future relationship with information processing technology -- the concept of coevolution, an agreement between two different organisms to change together, to interact in such a way that improvements in the chances for survival for one species can lead to improvements in the chances for survival of the other species.
  Perhaps yet another biological metaphor can help us foresee the transformation ahead.
  When a caterpillar transforms into a butterfly, it undergoes a biologically unique process.
