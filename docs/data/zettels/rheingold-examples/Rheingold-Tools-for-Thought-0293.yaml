  Alan Kay, whose Smalltalk team made impressive contributions to the Star interface, left to become the chief scientist at Atari.
  John Ellenby, who helped reengineer the Alto 2, became the chairman of Grid.
  In the fall of 1983, Bob Taylor resigned, after thirteen years leading the laboratory team he had built.
  Several of the PARC alumni became associated with those industry newcomers who had emerged from the homebrew computer days.
  Some of the former whiz kids from PARC were making alliances with the next generation of whiz kids.
  Charles Simonyi, by then in his early thirties, who was in charge of producing the word processing software for the Alto, left PARC to join Bill Gates, the twenty-seven-year-old chairman of Microsoft, a company that started out as a software supplier to the computer hobbyists in the Altair days of 1975, and is now the second-largest microcomputer software company in the world.
  Steve Jobs, chairman of Apple, then in his late twenties, visited PARC in 1979.
  He was given a demonstration of the Alto.
  Larry Tesler, the member of the PARC team that gave Jobs that demonstration, left PARC in 1980 and joined Apple's new secret project that Jobs promised would redefine the state of the art in personal computers.
  In 1983 Apple unveiled Lisa -- a machine that used a mouse, a bit-mapped screen, windows, and other features based on the Star-Alto-Smalltalk interface.
