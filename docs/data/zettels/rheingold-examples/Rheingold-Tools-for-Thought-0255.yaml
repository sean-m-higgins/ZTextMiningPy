  The rapid emergence of an economy based primarily on knowledge, Drucker predicted, would be the most significant social transformation of the last quarter of the twentieth century.
  Drucker noted something about the future of knowledge in the American economy that seemed to converge, from an unexpected but not unpredictable direction, with the course Engelbart had plotted for the augmentation project at the beginning of its second decade.
  Drucker was one of the first of a growing number of social scientists who have claimed that an examination of labor statistics reveals a great deal about the role of knowledge work in everybody's future.
  In 1973, ten years after his solo "Framework .
  Acknowledging their debt to Drucker's ideas, the authors pointed out that the special computer systems that had been evolving at ARC were designed to alleviate the problems associated with "the accelerating rate at which knowledge and knowledge work are coming to dominate the working activity of our society': In 1900 the majority and the largest single group of Americans obtained their livelihood from the farm.
  By 1940 the largest single group was industrial workers, especially semiskilled machine operators.
  By 1960, the largest single group was professional, managerial, and technical -- that is, knowledge workers.
  By 1975-80 this group will embrace the majority of Americans.
  The productivity of knowledge has already become the key to national productivity, competitive strength, and economic achievement, according to Drucker.
  It is knowledge, not land, raw materials, or capital, that has become the central factor in production.
