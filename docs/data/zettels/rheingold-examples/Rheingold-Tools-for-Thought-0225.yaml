note: |
  Doug Engelbart tends to think seriously about things when he finds something worth thinking about.
  And his own life is certainly not exempt from being an object of serious thinking.
  While he drove along a two-lane paved road that is now a freeway, he reckoned that he had about five and a half million working minutes remaining in his life.
  What value did he really want from that investment?
  At the age of twenty-five, in December of 1950, he started to think about what new goals he might set for himself.
  The way I grew up, if you had enough money to get by, that was okay; I never knew anybody who was rich.
  But by 1950, it looked to me like the world was changing so fast, and our problems were getting so much bigger, that I decided to look for a goal in life that would have the most payoff for mankind."
  For several months after he made the decision to commit himself to an appropriately humanitarian enterprise, Doug searched for the right one.
  He contemplated his situation and skills and thought about the various kinds of crusades he might join.
  With his radar training, and what he was beginning to learn about computers, Engelbart was also looking for a cause that wouldn't require him to retread his engineering education, or move too far away from his new home.
