  The screen was taller than most computer displays, and it looked different from other computer screens, even when seen from across the room.
  Instead of a single screen-sized frame filled with numbers or letters or graphs, there were a number of squares of various sized, known in Xerox parlance as windows, that looked like overlapping pieces of paper on a desk.
  The symbols and images were also distinctly sharper than what I was accustomed to seeing on a computer screen.
  The mouse, an update of Engelbart's innovation, was connected to the Alto with a thin wire.
  As Taylor slid the mouse around the desk surface next to the screen, a small dark pointer shaped like an arrow moved around the screen.
  When he clicked one of the buttons on top of the mouse or moved the pointer into a margin, the pointer changed shape and things happened on the screen.
  In 1984, Apple corporation's Macintosh computer introduced a mass market to this way of handling an electronic desktop.
  To Taylor, it wasn't particularly futuristic.
  Altos and Ethernets had been in operation since 1974 around here.
  By 1983, Bob Taylor was only half-satisfied with his progress toward what he and a few others set out to achieve twenty years ago, because he believed that the new technology was only halfway built.
