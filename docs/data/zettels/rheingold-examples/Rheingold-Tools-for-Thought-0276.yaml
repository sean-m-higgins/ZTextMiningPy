  The machine in another room that made the meeting possible was the latest kind of multiaccess computer that the time-sharing research of the last few years had produced.
  Using the project meeting as a model, Licklider and Taylor showed how computers could handle the informational housekeeping activities involved with a group process.
  More importantly, they demonstrated how this subtle kind of communication augmentation could enhance the creative informational activity that took place.
  The ability to switch from microscopic details to astronomical perspectives, to assemble and reassemble models, to find and replace files, to cut and paste and shuffle, to view some information publicly and make private notes at the same time, to thumb through the speaker's files or check his references while he is talking, made it possible for people to communicate with each other through the computer system in a way not possible in a nonaugmented meeting.
  Referring to their model technical meeting at SRI, Licklider and Taylor estimated that "In two days, the group accomplished with the aid of a computer what normally might have taken a week."
  This small group -- the people together with the hardware and software of a multiaccess computer -- constituted what Licklider and Taylor identified as one node of a larger, geographically distributed computer network.
  The key idea, Taylor and Licklider now recall, had been proposed by Wesley Clark in a cab ride to Dulles Airport, after a 1966 meeting about the network Taylor was trying to put together.
  The problem lay in deciding which levels of the existing computer and communication systems had to be changed to couple incompatible machines and software.
  Many of the planners believed that a huge "host" computer in the center of the country would have to be specially designed and programmed to act as a translator.
  Clark suggested that a small, general-purpose computer at each node could be turned into a "message processor."
