  To see how the movement developed, read the START-A-RELIGION message and its submessages.
  Although the conference tree that contained ORIGINS, along with its parent and sister and daughter conferences (as submessages and root messages are known in BBS jargon), was one of the most intriguing electronic gathering places I found in a few months of vicarious wanderings via my modem, it was far from the only unusual one.
  The pros and cons of religion, and the possibility of starting new ones or reviving old ones, seems to be a popular topic of discussion.
  ORIGINS was an example of the cybernetic variety.
  I ran across a few Christian boards and a meditators' BBS, but the most startling discovery was the Pagan faction who announced themselves with a message on a conference tree: The covenant of the Goddess is an umbrella organization for pagan groups of all kinds.
  It was created in the 60s to provide some structure (and maybe some muscle, since some groups were being harassed by the government) to an otherwise amorphous group of covens in Northern California, but eventually had members everywhere.
  A pagan group mostly refers to witches, although there are Druid groves and other strictly unallied organizations online as well.
  Witches means any affinity group which holds as one of its general tenets that Jehovah may not be the guy in charge after all -- that he is a powerful illusion created by an awful lot of misguided and power-hungry folks, and that the supreme being is and should be somebody with more of a sense of humor as well as compassion, not even to mention love.
  In short, it might be fair to claim that it's better than any other way, then it's probably pagan.
  These definitions are by exclusion because one way of defining the whole pagan movement is as a group that believes in saying yes to more.
