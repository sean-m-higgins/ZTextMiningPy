  It holds a position wholly its own; and the considerations it suggests are most interesting in their nature.
  In enabling mechanism to combine together general symbols, in successions of unlimited variety and extent, a uniting link is established between the operations of matter and the abstract mental processes of the most abstract branch of mathematical science.
  A new, a vast and a powerful language is developed for the future use of analysis, in which to wield its truths so that these may become of more speedy and accurate practical application for the purposes of mankind than the means hitherto in our possession have rendered possible.
  Thus not only the mental and the material, but the theoretical and the practical in the mathematical world, are brought into intimate connexion with each other.
  We are not aware of its being on record that anything partaking of the nature of what is so well designated the Analytical Engine has been hitherto proposed, or even thought of, as a practical possibility, any more than the idea of a thinking or a reasoning machine.
  As a Mathematician, Ada was excited about the possibility of automating laborious calculations.
  But she was far more interested in the principles underlying the programming of these devices.
  Had she not died so young, it is possible that Ada could have advanced the nineteenth-century state of the art to the threshold of true computation.
  Even thought the Engine was yet to be built, Ada experimented with writing sequences of instructions.
  She noted the value of several particular tricks in this new art, tricks that are still essential to modern computer languages--subroutines, loops and jumps.
