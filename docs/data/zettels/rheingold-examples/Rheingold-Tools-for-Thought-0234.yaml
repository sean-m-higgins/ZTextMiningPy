  Our culture has given us sophisticated procedures for dealing with problems, procedures that augment our innate capacity for learning new things by giving us the benefit of what others before us have learned.
  These ways of doing things are the software that creates civilization.
  A member of a preliterate culture of the remote New Guinea highlands, for example, possesses the same innate mental capabilities as a Western city-dweller, but something else must be added to the repertoire of what that New Guinea highlander knows how to do before he can drive a car, check out a book from a library, or write a letter.
  The "something extra" Engelbart emphasized, is not a property of the tool.
  It isn't the nervous system of the individual that separates the "civilized" person from the "primitive."
  To certain cultures that we deem primitive, the most sophisticated urbanite is decidedly lacking in the necessary survival skills.
  If the cultural situation of the previous paragraph were reversed, the same ignorance on the part of the displaced person would be evident: If you drop a lifelong New Yorker into the New Guinea Highlands, don't expect him or her to know how to build a grass shelter or what to do in a tropical storm.
  Somebody who knows what to do in those situations has to teach survival skills to the newcomer, thus augmenting his or her innate capacities.
  It is here that the original augmentation of human intellect comes in -- the tools and procedures that cultures make available to individuals: Our culture has evolved means for us to organize and utilize our basic capabilities so that we can comprehend truly complex situations and accomplish the processes of devising and implementing problem solutions.
  The ways in which human capabilities are thus extended are here called augmentation means, and we define the four basic classes of them: 1.
