  Quantum physicist Erwin Schrdinger pointed out that life defies the cosmic energy tide courtesy of our sun.
  As long as the sun keeps shining, the earth is not a closed system.
  Photochemical reactions on earth capture a tiny fraction of the sun's radiant energy and use it to complicate things.
  In his famous "What Is Life?"
  The relationship between negative energy and information, like Boole's obscure algebra, was just waiting to be found when Shannon started to wonder how messages manage to maintain their order in a medium where disorder is often high.
  The matter of devising a simple code and reliably transmitting it from place to place was very important to British cryptographers, and Shannon had done his own work in cryptography.
  The prediction of the behavior of electrical circuits used to transmit messages made of these codes was another of Shannon's interests.
  When he put it all together with a formal examination of how messages can be distinguished from noise, and found that the very equation he sought was a variation of the defining equation for entropy, Claude Shannon happened upon the fact that the universe plays twenty questions with itself.
  The formal foundations of information theory were laid down in two papers in 1948, and at their core were fundamental equations that had a definite relationship to Boltzmann's equations relating entropy to the degree of order in a system.
  But the general idea behind the equations was simple enough for Shannon to suggest a game as a way of understanding the quantitative dimension of coding and communication.
