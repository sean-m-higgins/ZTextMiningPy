note: |
  Sometimes serious issues were discussed in this manner, and sometimes long impassioned graffiti (known as "flames") were launched against a variety of targets ranging from the profound to the utterly inconsequential.
  Sometimes serious issues were disguised as flames, and vice versa.
  Branches and subbranches of such exchanges could continue for months, making up a kind of electronically embedded ad hoc literature.
  That was where the "hacker papers" came from.
  This particular counterpoint of flames on the subject of hackers, written by hackers, came to the attention of the "real world" because a Stanford professor of psychology named Philip Zimbardo discovered the dialogue and published it, with commentary, in Psychology Today magazine in 1980, twenty years after Rodman met Greenblatt et al.
  The exchange of flames began with a hacker's version of Luther's 95 theses, nailed, metaphorically, to the door of the electronic temple.
  A self-sworn ex-hacker who called himself "G. Gandalf" (the tradition is to give oneself a pseudonym on the public mail channel, like the "handles" used in the citizen's-band radio subculture) posted a bulletin entitled "Essay on Hacking," that said, among other things: In the middle of Stanford University there is a large concrete-and-glass building filled with computer terminals.
  When one enters this building through the glass doors, one steps into a different culture.
  Fifty people stare at terminal screens.
  Fifty faces connected to fifty bodies connected to 50 sets of fingers that pound on 50 keyboards ultimately linked to a computer.
