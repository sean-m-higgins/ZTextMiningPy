note: |
  The failure of Xerox to exploit the research at PARC was partially a result of the lack of the kind of infrastructure described by the automobile analogy.
  Technology transfer in such a fast-moving field as microelectronic devices is a tough enough gamble.
  The problem gets more complicated when those devices are intended to affect the way people think.
  Building a system from scratch and showing that it works is still a long way from convincing most of the people in the work force to change the way they've always done things.
  By the mid 1970s, the nation's smartest computer researchers realized that the Alto, Ethernet, and Smalltalk (an equally advanced computer language) prototypes created at PARC had advanced the state of interactive computing far beyond the level achieved by the ARPA-sponsored time-sharing projects that had revolutionized computers a decade previously.
  By the late 1970s, Xerox management was ready to think about turning PARC's successes into a product.
  While the PARC whiz kids raced ahead on advanced research into dozens of information-related sciences and technologies, the Star and the Ethernet were readied for market.
  Star was designed to be much more than a production-model Alto: The main memory was 512K, twice as much as the enhanced Alto, and the Star's processor was built to run three times as fast as the Alto.
  The Star's software included a language named Mesa (created in Taylor's lab), along with a whole toolkit of application programs for editing, filing, calculating, computing, creating graphics, distributing electronic mail.
  One of the clichs of the computer industry in the early 1980s was that "if Xerox had marketed the Star when it was technically ready to go, they would have stolen an industry out from under IBM and Apple."
