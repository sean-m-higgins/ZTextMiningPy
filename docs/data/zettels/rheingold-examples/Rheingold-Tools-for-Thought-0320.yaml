  It wasn't long before the rest of the team understood Alan's desire to bring children into the process of designing the same instrument that he and all the other computer scientists wanted to use themselves.
  Another aspect of Kay's contribution was more concrete: the absolute conviction that they were designing something meant for people to use.
  That might not sound too revolutionary today, but even as late as 1971, most of the top-flight computer scientists who believed that this tool was going to be more than just a gadget for computer programmers were at PARC.
  PARC in the early 1970s was a collection of the worlds best computer scientists, hardware engineers, physicists, programmers .
  Bob Taylor, Alan Kay, Butler Lampson, Bob Metcalfe, and their colleagues each had his own unique approach to creating personal computing, but they agreed on one fundamental assumption -- that their ultimate product should be as generally useful as a hammer, or pulley, or book.
  Secretaries and business executives would one day be able to use the same tool to help them perform the work.
  Architects and designers would have the power of modeling, forecasting, and simulation at their fingertips.
  A true personal computer, the diverse PARC groups agreed, ought to be usable by legislators and librarians, teachers and children.
  And a computer that could be commanded by looking at images on a screen and pointing to them by means of a mouse was certainly a lot more widely usable than a computer that required arcane keyboard-entered commands in order to function.
  The first Alto personal computer prototypes were distributed to PARC researchers in 1974.
