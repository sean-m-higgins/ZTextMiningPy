  He was sent over to America, at a time when it was indeed dangerous to take a North Atlantic cruise, to share crucial aspects of British cryptanalytic progress with American intelligence and to lend his intelligence to several American war-related scientific projects.
  It was during this American visit that Turing picked up practical knowledge of electronics.
  Turing had first become acquainted with what were then called "electronic valves" when he investigated the possibility of using the exotic vacuum-tube devices coming out of radar research to speed up the massive information-processing tasks needed by the Bletchley code-breakers.
  In America, Turing was involved in another hypersecret project, this time involving voice encryption -- what the spy novels call "scramblers."
  Because of this work on the device that was code-named "Delilah," Turing learned his electronics from some of the best in the business -- the engineers at Bell Laboratories in New York (including one named Claude Shannon, a prodigy of a different kind, who will enter the story again).
  By the end of the war, the knowledge that electronic technology could be used to speed up logical switching circuits, and the possibility of building working models of Turing's universal machines, led His Majesty's government to once again support an automatic calculating device.
  This time, it was not called the "Analytical Engine," but the "Automatic Computing Engine" -- or ACE, as it became known.
  At the end of World War II, despite the work in America of Mauchly and Eckert (ENIAC's inventors), the British were in an excellent position to win the race to build the first true electronic digital computer.
  But unfortunately for Alan Turing, postwar computer research in Britain was not pursued as aggressively and on the same scale as the American effort.
  Turing, of course, was in the thick of the postwar computer development effort, but not at the center, and certainly not in control.
