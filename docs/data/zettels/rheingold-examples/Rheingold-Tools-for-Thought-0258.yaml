  Before the counterculture made its media splash and thousands of affluent American offspring started acting weird and growing their hair long, places where powerful computers were to be found had already spawned their own brand of weirdo -- the hacker.
  The advent of this new subculture within the computer subculture was not the direct cause of ARC's downfall, but it was symptomatic of the problems Engelbart faced in the 1970s.
  Engelbart found himself caught between the conservatism of his employers and the radicalism of his best students.
  ARC had seemed a bit strange to the old-line data-processing types at SRI, and these new people hanging out at Doug's lab added cultural as well as technological differences to an already strained relationship.
  To say that SRI is conservative is an understatement.
  Although some of the subjects their researchers pursue can be unorthodox, their clients are such straitlaced institutions as the Defense Department, the intelligence community, and the top one hundred corporations.
  Hackers were barely tolerated in the long, clean, high-security halls of SRI.
  But when the counterculture started to infiltrate, and the rumors started about some of the hackers augmenting their consciousness in more ways than one, SRI brass became extremely uncomfortable.
  There was trouble from within, as well as from above.
  Some of the experiments in "new-age" social organization, encouraged by Engelbart himself, threatened to split the ARC group into two camps -- those who were still techies at heart, concerned only with the advancement of the state of computing art, and those who saw augmentation as an integral part of the wider countercultural revolution that was going on around them.
