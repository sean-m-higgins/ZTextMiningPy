  He was indeed a genius, to judge by what he planned to achieve as well as what he did achieve.
  His irascibility was notorious.
  Babbage was thoroughly British, stubbornly eccentric, tenaciously visionary, sometimes scatterbrained, and quite wealthy until he sank his fortune into his dream of building a calculating engine.
  Babbage invented the cowcatcher--that metal device on the front of steam locomotives that sweeps errant cattle out of the way.
  He also devised a means of analyzing entire industries, a method for studying complex systems that became the foundation of the field of operational research a hundred years later.
  When he applied his new method of analysis to a study of the printing trade, his publishers were so offended that they refused to accept any more of his books.
  Undaunted, he applied his new method to the analysis of the postal system of his day, and proved that the cost of accepting and assigning a value to every piece of mail according to the distance it had to travel was far more expensive than the cost of transporting it.
  The British Post Office boosted its capabilities instantly and economically by charging a flat rate, independent of the distance each piece had to travel--the "penny post" that persists around the world to this day.
  Babbage devised the first speedometer for railroads, and he published the first comprehensive treatise on actuarial theory (thus helping to create the insurance industry).
  He invented and solved ciphers and made skeleton keys for "unpickable locks"--an interest in cryptanalysis that he shared with later computer builders.
