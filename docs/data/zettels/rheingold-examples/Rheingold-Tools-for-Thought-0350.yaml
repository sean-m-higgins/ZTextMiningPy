note: |
  It isn't just a technical question for a fancier projector to solve.
  It's a question of how the world is established when it is constructed.
  How the author established the way in which people can relate to it.
  Remember the 'help agent' in the media room improvisation?
  This description of walking around the world sounds a lot like a theatrical improvisation.
  You walk up to the stage, and the director says, 'Okay, this is a new planet.
  You play an explorer.
  Go.'
  Nine times out of ten, something like that dwindles away, but if you are lucky you discover something useful about the character.
  Very rarely do you look back and say, "That was a wonderful story.'"
