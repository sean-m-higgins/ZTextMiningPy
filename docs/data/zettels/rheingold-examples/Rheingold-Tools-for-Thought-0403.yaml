note: |
  The idea of electronic communities is no longer just an idea.
  Lap-sized computers with crude display screens are already on their way to being commonplace.
  The visual displays will grow far more sophisticated, and the computers' processing power will increase as prices drop.
  Dynabooks and ARPAnets are suddenly not limited to research laboratories or military bureaucracies.
  On-line interactive communities are evolving right now, all around the world, through the wholly voluntary efforts of teenagers with modems, traveling business people with briefcase telecomputers, information utilities, computer bulletin board systems, and telecommunes of every stripe.
  Ted Nelson is voicing what a few people have known for a while, from the technical side -- that the intersection of communication and computer technologies will create a new communication medium with great possibilities.
  But he notes that the art of showing us those possibilities might belong to a different breed of thinker, people with different kinds of motivations and skills than the people who invented the technology.
  After Gutenberg came Cervantes.
  After movable type came novels.
  As Alan Kay pointed out, literature was the software of the era.
