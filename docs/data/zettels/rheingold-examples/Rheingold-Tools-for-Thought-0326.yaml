  The children then discover that programs can create structures more complex than any they can create by hand.
  They learn that a picture has several representations, of which only the most obvious -- the image -- appears on the screen.
  The most important representation is the symbolic model of the picture stored in the memory of the computer.
  One of the best ways to teach nonexperts to communicate with computers is to have them explore the levels of abstraction at which images can be manipulated.
  Kay noted that when he gave the same tool that the children used as both an amusement and an entrance into Smalltalk programming to an adult artist, the artist started out creating various designs similar to those he was accustomed to making on paper.
  Eventually the artist discovered that the properties of the new medium, and his increasing facility for commanding those properties, made it possible for him to explore graphic universes that he could never have created with his old media: "From the use of the computer for the impoverished simulation of an already existing medium," Kay wrote, "he had progressed to the discovery of the computer's unique properties for human expression."
  This freedom of viewpoint was only meant to be explored and demonstrated in a preliminary way in Smalltalk: It was Kay's hope that many new metaphors and languages would evolve as time went on, into what he called "observer languages": In an observer language, activities are replaced by "viewpoints" that become attached to one another to form concepts.
  For example, a dog can be viewed abstractly (as an animal), analytically (as being composed of organs, cells, and molecules), pragmatically (as a vehicle by a child), allegorically (as a human being in a fairy tale) and contextually (as a bone's way to fertilize a lawn).
  Observer languages are just now being formulated.
  They and their successors will be the communication vehicles of the 1980s.
