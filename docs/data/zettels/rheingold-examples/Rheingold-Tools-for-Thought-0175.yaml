  The problems to be overcome in achieving such a partnership were only partially a matter of building better computers and only partially a matter of learning how minds interact with information.
  The most important questions might not be about either the brain or the technology, but about the way they are coupled.
  Licklider, foreseeing the use of computers as tools to build better computers, concluded that 1960 would begin a transitional phase in which we humans would begin to build machines capable of learning to communicate with us, machines that would eventually help us to communicate more effectively, and perhaps more profoundly, with one another.
  By this time, he had strayed far enough off the course of his psychoacoustic research to be seduced by the prospect of building the device he first envisioned as a tool to help him make sense of his laboratory data.
  Like Babbage who needed a way to produce accurate logarithm tables, or Goldstine, who wanted better firing tables, or Turing, who wanted a perfectly definite way to solve mathematical and cryptological problems, Licklider began to move away from his former goals as he got caught up in the excitement of creating tools he needed.
  Except Licklider wasn't an astronomer and tinkerer like Babbage, a ballistician like Goldstine, or a mathematician and code-breaker like Turing, but an experimental psychologist with some practical electronic experience.
  He had set out to build a small model of one part of human awareness -- pitch perception -- and ended up dreaming about machines that could help him think about models.
  As other software visionaries before and after him knew very well, Licklider's vision, as grandiose as it might have been, wasn't enough in itself to ensure that anything would ever happen in the real world.
  An experimental psychologist, even an MIT professor, is hardly in a position to set armies of computer engineers marching toward an interactive future.
  Like von Neumann and Goldstine meeting on the railroad platform at Aberdeen, or Mauchly and Eckert encountering each other in an electronics class at the Moore School, Licklider happened upon his destiny through accidental circumstances, because of the time he spent at a place called "Lincoln Laboratory," an MIT facility for top-secret defense research, where he was a consultant during a critical transition period in the history of information processing.
