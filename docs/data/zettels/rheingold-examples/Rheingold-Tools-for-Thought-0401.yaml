  In a Xanadu-like system, royalties are automatically monitored by the host computer network, and are based largely on transmission time -- the amount of time people pay on-line attention to a given document.
  Every document in the system has an owner, and every owner is paid "a whiff of royalty" whenever somebody calls their document from the memory and displays it in words, sounds, or images.
  Everybody can create what text they want and put it on the system, from sonnets to pamphlets to textbooks, and everybody can quote or cite any other document.
  Documents can consist of links.
  Compendia, guided tours, directories, and indexes will spring up as independent documents; order would become a valuable commodity.
  Just as literary critics and librarians have found ways to organize and categorize the apparently chaotic stream of traditional literature, Nelson claims that people will spontaneously invent methods of organizing a hypertext-based body of literature.
  Nelson sees his ultimate concerns about the technology as political.
  Where most revolutionaries have regarded the computer as a tool of totalitarian oppression, a symbol of centralized power and dehumanization, Nelson has long known that these ideas are based on an outmoded kind of computer.
  Distributed networks of individually powerful computers are an entirely different thing from a central computer with a lot of extensions, and Nelson was one of the first to point out this technology's potential for creating social forms directed by the individual members, who are beyond the command of any old-fashioned, mainframe-type central control.
  He is enthused by the personal power that comes with having ready access to usable forms of information -- the bite of the old hacker apple -- and zealous about preserving the freedom to explore it in your own way: Those of us who grew up believing passionately in ideals that made our country great, such as liberty and pluralism and the accessibility of ideas, can hardly ignore the hope of such an opening-out.
