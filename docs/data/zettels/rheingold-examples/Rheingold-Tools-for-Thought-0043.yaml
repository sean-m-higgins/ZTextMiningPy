  In the foreseeable future, the flood of information to be counted and sorted would take fifteen or twenty years to tabulate!
  Like the stories about the origins of other components of computers, there is some controversy about the exact accreditation for the invention of the punched-card system.
  One account by a man named Willcox, who worked with both Billings and Hollerith in the census office stated: While the returns of the Tenth (1881) Census were being tabulated at Washington, Billings was walking with a companion through the office in which hundreds of clerks were engaged in laboriously transferring items of information from the schedules to the record sheets by the slow and heartbreaking method of hand tallying.
  As they were watching the clerks he said to his companion, 'There ought to be some mechanical way of doing this job, on the principle of the Jacquard loom, whereby holes in a card can regulate the pattern to be woven.'
  The seed fell on good ground.
  His companion was a talented young engineer in the office who first convinced himself that the idea was practicable and then that Billings had no desire to claim or use it.
  The "talented young engineer," of course, was Hollerith, who wrote this version in 1919: One Sunday evening at Dr. Billings' tea table, he had said to me that there ought to be a machine for doing the purely mechanical work of tabulating population and similar statistics.
  We talked the matter over and I remember .
  The Doctor said that he was not interested any further than to see some solution of the problem worked out.
  The system Hollerith put together used holes punched in designated locations on cardboard cards to represent the demographic characteristics of each person interviewed.
