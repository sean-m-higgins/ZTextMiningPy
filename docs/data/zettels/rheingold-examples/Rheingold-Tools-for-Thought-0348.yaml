note: |
  The portal is an interim metaphor to me.
  We need something richer.
  I'm looking for something that will click into place and re-explain the idea of the interface.
  Long before computers were available to regular folks, hackers on large mainframe computers were hooked on adventure games.
  Now there are adventure games that you can play on your home computer.
  What happens when you try to build a first-person adventure game?
  Maybe there are some graphics on the screen.
  Perhaps the screen is all around me.
  Maybe there is some text to read, or a sound track that reads it to me.
  All of these are important technical aspects, but they are peripheral to my concern.
