  Like a perfect space launch, all the minor random accidents canceled each other.
  For two hours, seventeen years ago, Doug Engelbart finally got his chance to take his peers -- augmentation pioneers and number crunchers as well -- on a flight through information space.
  Fortunately for the historical record, a film of the event was made.
  Those who were at the original event say that the sixteen-millimeter film is a poor shadow of the original show.
  During the original presentation, an advanced electronic projection system provided a sharply focused image, twenty times life sized, on a large screen.
  Doug was alone on the stage, the screen looming above and behind him as he sat in front of his CRT display, wearing the kind of earphone-microphone headsets that radar operators and jet pilots use, his hands resting on an unusual-looking control console connected to his chair.
  The specially designed input console swiveled so he could pull it onto his lap.
  A standard typewriter keyboard was in the center, and two small platforms projected about six inches on either side.
  On the platform to his left was a five-key device he used for entering commands, and on the platform to the right was the famous "mouse" that is only now beginning to penetrate the personal computing market -- a device the size of a pack of cigarettes, with buttons on the top, attached to the console with a wire.
  Doug moved it around with his right hand.
