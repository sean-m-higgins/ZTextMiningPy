  I want to dive in and emerge bone-dry in the Library of Alexandria, the day before it burned."
  A few groups on the leading edge of cognitive technology have been trying to find images to help them in their effort to materialize a mass-marketable version of Bush's Memex, Engelbart's Augmentation Workshop, and Kay's Dynabook.
  Those people who are attempting to design these devices share an assumption that such machines will evolve from today's computer technology into something that will probably not resemble the computers we see today.
  Ideally, we won't see these hypothetical computers of tomorrow, because they will be invisible, built into the environment itself.
  Try to imagine a computer that is nowhere to be seen, and is set up to attend to your every wish, informationally speaking.
  You enter a room (or put a helmet over your head), and the room (or the helmet) provides multisensory representations of anything, real or imaginary, you can think of to ask it to represent.
  Science fiction writers of the past decades have done their share of speculating on what one might do in such a representationally capable environment.
  You could, for example, go skiing in the Alps with wraparound full-color three-dimensional visual display, authentic panphonic soundtrack, biting cold air, ultraviolet-rich high-altitude sunshine, spray of powder snow on your cheeks, the feeling of skis beneath your feet, of being impelled down a slope.
  But you shouldn't have to limit your use of such a universal information medium to a real terrestrial experience.
  You could explore a black hole in a neighboring galaxy, navigate through tour nervous system, become a Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's court.
