  By this time, he had not only dreamed up the specifications for the full-blown version of this new information processing system, he had managed to attract a few equally fanatic allies.
  The basic note-keeping scheme that started it all was meant to have a system for taking care of all backtracking.
  The next step was to expand this capability to handle alternative versions and to show the user which parts of different versions are the same and which are different.
  This versioning capability, which Nelson now estimates to consume about 5 percent of the Gross National Product -- from the boiler-plate paragraphs used by attorneys to the 47 different versions of the 747 design that are stored in Boeing's computers.
  In real life, there is hardly ever such a thing as "the contract" or "the 747 blueprint."
  Mixtures of standard and custom features that make for slightly different versions of contracts or blueprints are more often the case.
  Historical tracing and versioning, however, don't make for much more than a powerful word processing system.
  Things started getting extradimensional when Nelson thought about adding links.
  Engelbart thinks that he and Nelson just happened to come up with something similar around the same time, although Engelbart had the technology and the wherewithal to actually get such a system up and running.
  The whole idea started out as a kind of computer-dynamized footnote -- a way to jump from part of the text to something outside the main body of the current document.
