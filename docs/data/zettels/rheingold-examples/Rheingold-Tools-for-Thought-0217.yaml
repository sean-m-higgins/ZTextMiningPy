  Anonymous," Milojkovic sees nothing wrong with a little compulsiveness in regard to learning: "I can think of nothing more natural than to fall in love with knowledge," he said, "and hackers are so deeply in love with knowledge of the computers that they're just swept off their feet."
  A case in point: David Rodman.
  When last we saw him, lurking in the background of the MacHack versus Dreyfus match, an acidhead teenage dropout hacker, he was almost certainly headed for a sunken-eyed, computer-nut future.
  In fact, quite the opposite turned out to be the case.
  He was doing quite well for himself, even at sixteen, as a freelance programmer.
  He got some offers to set up computer systems for social service bureaucrats, so he moved to D.C. in his early twenties.
  By 1972, David found himself up to his ears in the same problem that plagued Herman Hollerith -- handling huge data bases.
  In fact, designing probes of the U.S. Census information, now stored on magnetic tape, was David's specialty.
  He moved back to Cambridge to work for a software think tank, did more than a few jobs for agencies he doesn't want to name, and in 1978 he decided it was time to turn what he knew into a marketable product.
  David Rodman ended up creating and marketing a tool for managing data bases, a program that he designed to be usable by microcomputer owners.
