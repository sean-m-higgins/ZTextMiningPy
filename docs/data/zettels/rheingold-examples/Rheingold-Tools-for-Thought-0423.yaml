  Sexually oriented CBBS and dial-a-date boards are an entrance into yet another subculture, some members of which use the system to arrange real-life assignations with compatible companions, but most of whom use the system to live out fantasy sex lives consisting of hot dialogues with other anonymous participants.
  Because computer programs can be sent over the telephone wires as easily as words or numbers, some boards engage in software piracy -- passing along proprietary software without paying the licensing fee.
  Others dispense "public domain" software as a community service.
  Some are exclusive, and many are promiscuous, about who is allowed to write as well as read messages.
  Then there are folks who are starting to use temporary on-line communities as art forms and as experiments in changing the consciousness of larger communities like neighborhoods and cities.
  In 1983, a literary group in Seattle that called itself Invisible Seattle instigated the creation of a fifteen chapter mystery story written by a representative sampling of the half-million citizens of the city itself.
  The collective novel was not a new form, as far as the more standard kinds of networks go.
  EIES started a serial years before, in which different writers took on the personae of various characters and wrote the story like a conference.
  Invisible Seattle, however, sent "literary construction workers" out into the city looking for people from all works of life who were willing to contribute plots, words, ideas, which were communicated from the point of origin to the other nodes throughout the city via a temporary arrangement of video arcade game parts, two larger personal computers, some custom written software, and six smaller personal computers.
  What do Xanadu, EIES, The Source, Clyde Ghost Monster, and Invisible Seattle have to do with the technology created by Turing, von Neumann, Licklider, et al.
