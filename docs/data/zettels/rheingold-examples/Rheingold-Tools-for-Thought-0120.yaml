  But Wiener might never have worked with Rosenblueth if it wasn't for the Battle of Britain.
  Like von Neumann, Wiener's most important need was for interesting problems.
  Like von Neumann, he knew that the quantum revolution was the most interesting problem of the 1920s.
  And one of the effects of quantum physics on the young mathematician's thinking was to convince him that some of the most interesting problems of purely theoretical mathematics could end up having the most concrete applications in the real world.
  Another effect of quantum physics was the importance of probability and statistical measures for dealing with phemomena based on uncertain information.
  Wiener's familiarity with these concepts was to mature under unexpected circumstances.
  Like von Neumann and Goldstine and Eckert, in the late 1930s Wiener wasn't yet aware that ballistics would be the avenue for bringing his knowledge of probability and statistics to bear on the most pragmatic problems, eventually to yield most astonishing results.
  But, like them, he would soon come to understand that his war-related task was leading to profound scientific consequences far beyond the bounds of ballistics.
  The scene was set for the emergence of Wiener's astounding results, not by any series of scientific events, but by the political circumstances of the early 1940s.
  When war broke out in Europe, Bush assigned Wiener to the antiaircraft control project at MIT, under the direction of Warren Weaver, himself a distinguished mathematician.
