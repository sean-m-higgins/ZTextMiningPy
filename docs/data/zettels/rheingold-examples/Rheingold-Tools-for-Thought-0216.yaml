  One of the oldest rules of the game is "thou shalt not do unto ordinary computer users what thou hast done to other hackers."
  Almost all of the old-time hackers deplore what the young computer trespassers and crashers did -- "dark-side hacking" -- although the anarchist minority still insist that the ultimate freedom is the freedom to figure out how the communication-computing system works, and declare that the burden of protection against trespassing ought to be on the system programmer who has files to protect, not on the explorer who might tap in during some midnight jaunt through the network.
  Real computer criminals aside, the concern of the noncomputing public over the hacker controversy does seem a bit strange.
  After all, these people aren't accused of mayhem or arson -- just of being very smart when it comes to knowing how to operate computers.
  The capacity for scapegoating is very high in a culture where most people have been led to believe that computers are either smarter than they are or too complicated for ordinary people to use.
  James Milojkovic, an associate of Zimbardo's at Stanford who was writing his psychology doctoral thesis about the cognitive and motivational impact of the microcomputer, came to the hackers' defense.
  In a 1982 interview, Milojkovic said he spent plenty of time around hackers, and saw nothing pathological about what they were doing.
  In regard to all the public concern about what threat (noncriminal) hackers might pose, he said "clearly it's nonsense.
  I think what's happening is that there's some sort of fear that maybe what they're doing with the machines is aimed against us."
