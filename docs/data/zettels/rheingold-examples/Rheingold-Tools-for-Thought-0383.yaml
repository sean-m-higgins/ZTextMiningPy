  Because the development of better products in this particular market also means the development of better means of augmenting human intelligence, the evolution of this kind of machine will be rather closely coupled with the future evolution of human thought: It is the goal of those who are involved in the commercial development of expert-systems technology to incorporate that technology into some device that can be sold.
  But the environment in which expert systems operate is our own cognitive environment; it is within this sphere of activity -- people solving their problems -- that the eventual expert-system products must be found useful.
  They will be engineered to our minds.
  It is a long way from the expert systems developed in the research laboratories to any products that fit into people's lives; in fact it is difficult even to envision what such products will be.
  Egon Loebner of Hewlett-Packard Laboratories tells of a conversation he had many years ago with Vladimir Zworykin, the inventor of television technology.
  Loebner asked Zworykin what he had in mind for his invention when he was developing the technology in the 1920s -- what kind of product he thought his efforts would produce.
  The inventor said that he had a very clear idea of the eventual use of TV: He envisioned medical students in the gallery of an operating room getting a clear picture on their TV screens of the operation being conducted below them.
  One cannot, at the outset, understand the application of a new technology, because it will find its way into realms of application that do not exist.
  Loebner has described this process in terms of the technological niche, paralleling evolution theory.
  Like the species and their environment, inventions and their applications are co-defined -- they constantly evolve together, with niches representing periods of relative stability, into a new reality.
