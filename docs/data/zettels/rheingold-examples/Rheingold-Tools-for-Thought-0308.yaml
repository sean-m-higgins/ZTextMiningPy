  LOGO, the computer language developed by Papert, his colleague Wallace Fuerzing, and others at MIT and at the consulting firm of Bolt, Bernack & Newman, was created for a purpose that was shockingly different from the purposes that had motivated the creation of previous computer languages.
  FORTRAN made it easier for scientists to program computers.
  COBOL made it easier for accountants to program computers.
  LISP, some might say, made it easier for computers to program computers.
  LOGO, however, was an effort to make it easier for children to program computers.
  Although its creators knew that the LOGO experiment could have profound implications in artificial intelligence and computer science as well as in education, the project was primarily intended to create a tool for teaching thinking and problem-solving skills to children.
  The intention was to empower rather than to suppress children's natural desire to solve problems in ways they find fun and rewarding.
  Beginning in 1968, children between the ages of eight and twelve were introduced to programming through the use of attractive graphics and a new approach that put the power to learn in the hands of the people who were doing the learning.
  By learning how to use LOGO to have fun with computers, students were automatically practicing skills that would generalize to other parts of their lives.
  Papert had observed from both his computer science and developmental psychology experience that certain of these skills are "powerful ideas" that can be used at any age, in any subject area, because they have to do with knowing how to learn .
