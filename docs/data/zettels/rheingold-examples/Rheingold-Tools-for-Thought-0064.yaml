  Even the best of the old-style cryptographers couldn't suggest a solution.
  The British high command recruited brilliant mathematicians, engineers, and logicians, inadvertently creating one of the seminal research groups in the field that was to be known as artificial intelligence.
  Among them was Donald Michie, then only twenty-two, who was later to become the leading British machine intelligence researcher.
  Another very young colleague who later distinguished himself was I. J.
  Good, a prankster who once wrote Her Majesty the Queen suggesting that he be made peer of the realm, because then his friends would be forced to remark, "Good Lord, here comes Lord Good," when they saw him coming.
  The place known as Bletchley Park is far less famous than Omaha Beach, but many historians contend that the European war was won, in large part, in a closely guarded Victorian mansion in Hertfordshire, England, by the group of thinkers who succeeded in breaking the German code.
  The brilliant, young, unorthodox code-crackers were housed near Bletchley Park while they performed their role in the top-secret operation.
  One of the code breakers was twenty-eight-year-old Alan Turing.
  Turing was eccentric, fun-loving, disheveled, painfully honest, erratic, introspective, prodigiously and elegantly brilliant, and somewhat inept socially.
  Turing was an early model of the similar maladroit and analogously otherworldly computer hackers who were to come later: He was a sloppy dresser and a passionate chessplayer, fond of children's radio programs and dedicated to long-distance running.
