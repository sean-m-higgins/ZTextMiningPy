  First, some of their members are computer scientists and engineers who understand the concept of man-computer interaction and the technology of interactive multiaccess systems.
  Second, others of their members are creative people in other fields and disciplines who recognize the usefulness and who sense the impact of interactive multiaccess computing upon their work.
  Third, the communities have large multiaccess computers and have learned to use them.
  The authors were looking beyond the networks of their day, and the computer systems that were commercially available, to the technology they knew would be possible and affordable on a large scale within decades.
  Convinced that the technology they and their colleagues had created, and the community of users that had grown up around that technology, were the forerunners to far more powerful and more widely usable systems, they called for the development of a version of certain time-sharing systems into a tool that could be used to amplify human communications: .
  These new computer systems we are describing differ from other computer systems advertised with the same labels: interactive, time-sharing, multiaccess.
  They differ by having a greater degree of open-endedness, by rendering more services, and above all by providing facilities that foster a working sense of community among their users.
  The commercially available time-sharing services do not yet offer the power and flexibility of software resources -- the "general purposeness" -- of interactive multiaccess systems of the System Development Corporation in Santa Monica, the University of California at Berkeley, Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge and Lexington, Mass.
  The thousand people include many of the leaders of the ongoing revolution in the computer world.
  For over a year they have been preparing for the transition to a radically new organization of hardware and software, designed to support many more simultaneous users than the current systems, and to offer them -- through new languages, new file-handling systems, and new graphic displays -- the fast, smooth interaction required for truly effective man-computer partnership.
