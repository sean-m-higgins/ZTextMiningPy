  And there were those who felt that even Doug's technological ideas, although they might have once been radical and futuristic, were becoming outmoded.
  The idea of augmentation teams and high-level time-shared systems began to seem a bit old-hat to the younger folks who were exploring the possibility of personal computers.
  In the early 1970s, some of Engelbart's first and most important recruits, who had helped him create the first NLS system, left SRI for PARC, the new research center Xerox was putting together.
  The new Xerox facility was a hotbed of augmentation-oriented thought, but with a major difference -- the advent of large-scale integrated circuitry made it possible to dream of, and even design, high-powered computers that could fit on an individual's desk.
  This emphasis on one person, one computer made for important philosophical and technical differences with Engelbart's approach.
  For a while, Engelbart at SRI and his former students at Xerox were engaged in collaboration, but eventually PARC and ARC drifted apart.
  Doug still dreamed of creating augmentation centers in universities and industries, providing a service for any team of people who worked with information.
  The former ARC members were looking forward to an even wider potential computer-using population.
  The idea at Xerox was to use the new integrated circuit technology to create computers more powerful than the previous generations of minicomputers -- and to devote an entire computer to each person, instead of sharing it among thirty or forty users.
  PARC, as we shall see, went on to become the new mecca for those who saw the computer as a tool for augmenting the human intellect.
