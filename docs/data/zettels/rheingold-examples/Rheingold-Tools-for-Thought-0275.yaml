  The process of communication, therefore, is a process of externalizing mental models.
  Spoken language, the written word, numbers, and the medium of printing were all significant advances in the human ability to externalize and agree upon models.
  Each of those developments, in their turn, transformed human culture and increased collective control over our environment.
  In this century, the telephone system added a potent new modeling medium to the human communication toolkit.
  Licklider and Taylor declared that the combination of computer and communication technologies, if it could be made accessible to individuals, had the potential to become the most powerful modeling tool ever invented.
  As an example of how a prototype computer communication system could be used to boost the process of decision-making, Licklider and Taylor described an actual meeting that had taken place on just such a system.
  It was a project meeting involving the members of a computer-science research team.
  Although all the participants in the meeting were in the same room, they spent their time looking at their display screens while they talked.
  A variety of diagrams, blocks of text, numbers, and graphs passed before their eyes via those screens.
  The facility was, in fact, Doug Engelbart's Augmentation Research Center.
