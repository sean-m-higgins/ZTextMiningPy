  In the rest of the paper, Turing presented, then countered, a number of principal objections to the possibility of artificial intelligence.
  The titles Turing gave these objections reveal his whimsical streak "The Theological Objection," "The 'Heads in the Sand' Objection," "The Mathematical Objection," "Lady Lovelace's Objection," "The Argument from Consciousness," "Arguments from the Continuity in the Nervous System," "The Argument from Informality of Behavior," and "The Argument from Extrasensory Perception."
  In this paper, Turing made evident his knowledge of his intellectual antecedents in this field by countering the objection raised by Ada in her commentary, in which she stated the problem that is still cited by most people in an argument about the possibility of machine intelligence: "The Analytical Engine has no pretensions to originate anything.
  It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform.
  Turing pointed out that Ada might have spoken differently if she had seen, as he had, evidence that electronic equipment could be made to exhibit a primitive form of "learning," by which programs would be able to eventually master tasks that had never been specifically programmed, but which emerged from trial-and-error techniques that had been preprogrammed.
  Turing's work in computing, mathematics, and other fields was cut short by his tragic death in June, 1954, at the age of forty-two.
  Besides being a genius, Turing was also a homosexual.
  During the early 1950s, following the defection of two homosexual spies to the Soviet Union, Great Britain was an especially harsh environment for anyone caught engaging in prohibited sexual acts -- especially for someone who had something even more secret than radar or the atomic bomb in his head.
  Turing was arrested and convicted of "gross indecency," and sentenced to probation on the condition that he submit to humiliating and physically debilitating female hormone injections.
  Turing's war record was still too secret to even be mentioned in his defense.
