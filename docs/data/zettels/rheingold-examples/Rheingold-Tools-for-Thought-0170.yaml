note: |
  As he began to think about the respective strengths and deficiencies of computers and brains, it occurred to him that what he was seeking was an alternative to the human-computer relationship as it then existed.
  Since the summer of 1956, when they met at Dartmouth to define the field, several young computer and communication scientists Licklider knew from MIT had been talking about a vaguely distant future when machines would surpass human intelligence.
  Licklider was more concerned with the shorter-term potential of computer-human relations.
  Even at the beginning, he realized that technical thinkers of every kind were starting to run up against the problems he had started noticing in 1957.
  Let the AI fellows worry about ways to build chess-playing or language translating machines.
  What he and a lot of other people needed was an intelligent assistant.
  Although he was convinced by his "religious conversion to interactive computing" -- a phrase that has been used over and over again by those who participated in the events that followed -- Licklider still knew too little about the economics of computer technology to see how it might become possible to actually construct an intelligent laboratory assistant.
  Although he didn't know how or when computers would become powerful enough and cheap enough to serve as "thinking tools," he began to realize that the general-purpose computer, if it was set up in such a way that humans could interact with it directly, could evolve into something entirely different from the data processors and number crunchers of the 1950s.
  Although the possibility of creating a personal tool still seemed economically infeasible, the idea of modernizing a community-based resource, like a library, began to appeal to him.
  He got fired up about the idea Vannevar Bush had mentioned in 1945, the concept of a new kind of library to fit the world's new knowledge system.
