  Additional tendencies are to employ the computer trivially (simulating what paper, paints, and a file cabinet can do), as a crutch (using the computer to remember things that we can perfectly well remember ourselves) or as an excuse (blaming the computer for human failings).
  More serious is the human propensity to place faith in and assign higher powers to an agency that is not completely understood.
  The fact that many organizations actually base their decisions on -- worse, take their decisions from -- computer models is profoundly disturbing given the current state of computer art .
  The fact of simulation is so seductive to human perception, and so potentially useful in "real world" applications, that its widespread use is inevitable, once personal computers grow sophisticated and inexpensive enough.
  The ethics of how and for what purposes simulations should and should not be used are only beginning to be formulated.
  The historical events, debates in PTAs and legislatures, and growth in public concern that will accompany the introduction of this medium will help determine the shape of the future ethics of simulation.
  The best place to look for expert guidance, Kay suggests, might be to those of us who are the least prejudiced by precomputer ways of thinking: Children's Computer Ethic Children who have not yet lost much of their sense of wonder and fun have helped us to find an ethic about computing: Do not automate the work you are engaged in, only the materials.
  If you like to draw, do not automate drawing; rather, program your personal computer to give you a new set of paints.
  If you like to play music, do not build a "player piano"; instead program yourself a new kind of instrument.
  The way we think about computers -- as machines, as systems that mimic human capabilities, as tools, as toys, as competitors, or as partners -- will play a large part in determining their future role in society.
