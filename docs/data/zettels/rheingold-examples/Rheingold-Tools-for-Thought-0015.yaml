  He started the 1980s as a director of Atari Corporation's long-term research effort, and in 1984 he left Atari to become a "research fellow" for Apple Corporation.
  Along with his hard-won credentials as one of the rare original thinkers who is able to implement his thoughts via the craft of software design, Kay also has a reputation as a lifelong insubordinate.
  Since the first time he was thrown out of a classroom for knowing more than the teacher, Kay's avowed goal has been to build a "fantasy amplifier" that anyone with an imagination could use to explore the world of knowledge on their own, a "dynamic medium for creative thought" that could be as useful and thought-provocative to children in kindergarten as it would be to scientists in a research laboratory.Licklider, Engelbart, Taylor, and Kay are still at work, confident that many more of us will experience the same thrill that has kept them going all these years--what Licklider, still at MIT, calls the "religious conversion" to interactive computing.
  Engelbart works for Tymshare Corporation, marketing his "Augment" system to information workers.
  Taylor is setting up another computer systems research center, this time under the auspices of the Digital Equipment Corporation, and is collecting people once again, this time for a research effort that will bring computing into the twenty-first century.
  Kay, at Atari, continued to steer toward the fantasy amplifier, despite the fact that their mother company was often described in the news media as "seriously troubled."
  It is fair to assume that he will continue to work toward the same goal in his new association with Steve Jobs, chairman of Apple and a computer visionary of a more entrepreneurial bent.
  The pioneers, although they are still at work, are not the final characters in the story of the computer quest.
  The next generations of innovators are already at work, and some of them are surprisingly young.
  Computer trailblazers in the past tended to make their marks early in life--a trend that seems to be continuing in the present.
