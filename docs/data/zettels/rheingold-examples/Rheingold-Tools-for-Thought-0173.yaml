  It will convert static equations or logical statements into dynamic models so the human operator can examine their behavior.
  In general, it will carry out the routinizable, clerical operations that fill the intervals between decisions.
  In addition, the computer will serve as a statistical-inference, decision-theory, or game-theory machine to make elementary evaluations of suggested courses of action whenever there is enough basis to support a formal statistical analysis.
  Finally, it will do as much diagnosis, pattern matching, and relevance recognizing as it profitably can, but it will accept a clearly secondary status in those areas.
  The first research in the 1950s into the use of computing equipment for assisting human control of complex systems was a direct result of the need for a new kind of air defense command-and-control system.
  Licklider, as a human factors expert, had been involved in planning these early air defense communication systems.
  Like the few others who saw this point as early as he did, he realized that the management of complexity was the main problem to be solved during the rest of the twentieth century and beyond.
  Machines would have to help us keep track of the complications of keeping global civilization alive and growing.
  And humans were going to need new ways of attacking the big problems that would result form our continued existence and growth.
  Assuming that survival and a tolerable quality of existence are the most fundamental needs for all sane, intelligent organisms, whether they are of the biological or technological variety, Licklider wondered if the best arrangement for both the human and the human-created symbol-processing entities on this planet might not turn out to be neither a master-slave relationship nor an uneasy truce between competitors, but a partnership.
