  Wiener, an insecure, far less worldly, sometimes vain, and often hypersensitive personality, simply didn't go to as much trouble to make an impression outside the realm of mathematics, where he was confident to the point of arrogance.
  Bertrand Russell wrote of Wiener, in a letter to a friend: At the end of Sept. an infant prodigy named Wiener, Ph.D. (Harvard), aged 18, turned up with his father who teaches Slavonic languages there, having come to America to found a vegetarian communist colony, and having abandoned that intention for farming, and farming for the teaching of various subjects.
  The youth has been flattered, and thinks himself God Almighty -- there is a perpetual contest between him and me as to which is to do the teaching.
  Like Babbage, Wiener was famous for the feuds he carried on.
  While a student at Gttingen, he impressed the administrative head of the university, Richard Courant, but Wiener accused him of misappropriating several of the younger man's mathematical ideas and appending Courant's own name to them.
  When he returned to Cambridge, the outraged young genius turned his energies to a novel that was never published, about someone who bore a remarkable resemblance to Courant, and who was depicted as a man who stole the ideas of young geniuses.
  Before World War I, Wiener wrote pieces for Encyclopedia Americana, taught philosophy at Harvard and mathematics at the University of Maine.
  During World War I, Private Wiener was assigned to the U.S. Army's Aberdeen proving Grounds in Maryland, where he was one of the mathematicians responsible for the computation of firing tables.
  His service in 1918 was one of the reasons it was natural for Wiener's friend Vannevar Bush to think of Norbert thirty years later, when the allies needed a way to put firing tables directly into the radar-guided mechanism of antiaircraft guns.
  After the end of World War I, Norbert Wiener joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as an instructor of mathematics.
