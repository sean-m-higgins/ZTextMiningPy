  While it was only barely interactive in the sense that Licklider desired, Whirlwind was the first computer fast enough to solve aerodynamic equations in "real time" -- as the event that was being modeled was actually happening.
  Real-time computation was not only a practical necessity for the increasingly complicated job of designing high-speed jet aircraft; it was a necessary prerequisite for creating the guidance systems of rockets, the technological successors to jet aircraft.
  Ironically, by the time SAGE became fully operational in 1958, the entire concept of ground-based air defense against bomber attack had been made obsolete on one shocking day in October, 1957, when a little beeping basketball by the odd name of "Sputnik" jolted the American military, scientific, and educational establishments into a frenzy of action.
  The fact that the Russians could put bombs in orbit set off the most intensive peacetime military research program in history.
  When the Soviets repeated their triumph by putting Yuri Gagarin into space, a parallel impetus started the U.S. manned space effort on a similar course.
  In the same way that the need for ballistics calculations indirectly triggered the invention of the general-purpose digital computer, the aftermath of Sputnik started the development of interactive computers, and eventually led directly to the devices now known as personal computers.
  Just as von Neumann found himself in the center of political-technological events in the ENIAC era, Licklider was drawn into a central role in what became known as "the ARPA era."
  The "space race" caused a radical shakeup in America's defense research bureaucracy.
  It was decided at the highest levels that one of the factors holding up the pace of space-related research was the old, slow way of evaluating research proposals by submitting them for anonymous review by knowledgeable scientists in the field (a ritual known as "peer review" that is still the orthodox model for research funding agencies).
  The new generation of Camelot-era whiz kids from the think tanks, universities, and industry, assembled by Secretary McNamara in the rosier days before Vietnam, were determined to use the momentum of the post-Sputnik scare to bring the Defense Department's science and technology bureaucracy into the space age.
