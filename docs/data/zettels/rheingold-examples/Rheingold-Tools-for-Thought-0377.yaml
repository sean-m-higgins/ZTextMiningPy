note: |
  If you increase the number of cases to be decided between from two to three, it gets even more snarled: After two moves on a triple-branching tree, there are nine branches (instead of four); after three moves there are twenty-seven (instead of eight), etc., ad infinitum.
  So you have to build a system to weed out the legal but absurd moves, as well as a strategy to evaluate two or three moves in advance.
  What a machine needs to know, practically before it can get started, is that the mysterious something that human chessmasters know that enables them to rule out all but a few possibilities when they look at a chessboard (or hear a chess situation described to them verbally).
  When a human contemplates a chess position, that person's brain accomplishes an information processing task of cosmic complexity.
  The human brain has obviously found a way to bypass the rules of exhaustive search -- a way to beat the numbers involved in searching problem space.
  This is the vitally important trick that seems to have eluded artificial intelligence program designers from the beginning.
  What does the human chessmaster do to prune the tree created by brute-force programs, and how can computers help other humans perform similar tasks?
  The point of expert-system building is not to outdo the brain but to help human reasoning by creating an intelligent buffer between brain processes and the complexities of the world -- especially information-related complexities.
  A problem-pruning tool could be an important component of such an informational intermediary.
  Human brains seem to accomplish tasks in ways that would require absurd amounts of computer power if they were to be duplicated by machines.
