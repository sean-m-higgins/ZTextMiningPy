  If one thing was sacred to Johnny, it was the power of human thought to penetrate the mysteries of the universe, and the will of human beings to apply that knowledge to practical ends.
  He had other things on his own mind at the time -- from the secrets of H-bomb design to the structure of logic machines -- but he appeared to be most keen on the idea that these devices might evolve into some kind of intellectual extension.
  How much more might a thinker like himself accomplish with the aid of such a machine?
  One biographer put it this way: Von Neumann's enthusiasm in 1944 and 1945 had first been generated by the challenge of improving the general-purpose computer.
  He had been a proponent of using the latest in computing machines in the atomic bomb project, but he realized that for the impending hydrogen bomb project still better and faster machines were needed.
  In the theoretical level he was intrigued by the fact that there appeared to be organizational parallels between the brain and computers and that these parallels might lead to formal-logic theories encompassing both computers and brains; moreover, the logical theories would constitute interesting abstract logics in their own right.
  He was cautious in assuming similarity between a computer and the awesome functioning of the human brain, especially as in 1944 he had little preparation in physiology.
  Rather he regarded the computer as a technical device functioning as an extension of its user; it would lead to an aggrandizement of the human brain, and von Neumann wanted to push this aggrandizement as far and as fast as possible.
  There is no dispute that Mauchly, Eckert, Goldstine, and Von Neumann worked together as a team during this crucial gestation period of computer technology.
  The team split up in 1946, however, so the matter of accrediting specific ideas has become a sticky one.
