  Not that drawings of rabbits, or even drawings of transistors, mean the millennium; but that a new way of working and seeing was possible.
  The techniques of the computer screen are general and applicable to everything -- but only if you can adapt your mind to thinking in terms of computer screens.
  Sutherland was Twenty-six when he succeeded Licklider as director of ARPA's Information Processing Techniques Office.
  Then he was succeeded by Bob Taylor when he left for Harvard in the mid-1960s, to work on 3-D head-mounted displays (like miniature televisions in eyeglass frames) and other exotic graphics systems.
  When David Evans tried to lure him to Utah, Sutherland said he would do it if Evans agreed to become a business partner -- and thus the pioneering computerized flight simulation and image generation company of Evans & Sutherland was born.
  Kay showed up at Utah in November of 1966.
  His first task was to read a pile of manuscript Evans gave him -- Ivan Sutherland's thesis.
  The way Evans ran the graduate program, you weren't supposed to be around campus very long or very much.
  You were supposed to be a professional and move on to high-level consulting jobs in industry.
  The job he found for Alan Kay was with a hardware genius named Ed Cheadle.
