note: |
  He was there when his motley colleagues began to build the programming and operating systems for the TX-0 and PDP-1 computer hardware, thus establishing the first software thrust into the age of interactive computing.
  David was also there when Joseph Weizenbaum, to his later regret unveiled ELIZA, probably the most widely quoted and widely misunderstood program in history -- the program that seems to be an uncannily perceptive psychiatrist, but is actually a programmer's semantic trick.
  David came upon the hackers through a mixture of mischief and happenstance.
  He was one of those prodigies who was angry about having a brain like his trapped for another eight years in the body of a child.
  Since he was six, he had been an exceptional musician, but he gave up the piano at ten because he despised performing for adults.
  He was a loner, a wanderer, a looker through doorways, an urban spelunker -- a snoop, but not a thief, unless you consider knowledge of how to find your way through a complicated system as a stealable property.
  By the age of fifteen, David and his friends could find their way into any building in the MIT complex, via the system of underground utility tunnels.
  Wandering through the halls of MIT, where his father worked in the medical school, was one of his favorite pastimes.
  He liked to try doors and see what was behind the unlocked ones.
  When he cast his eyes on those strange guys gathered around an odd-looking television set with wires coming out of it, and then joined them at a game called "Spacewar," using a control panel made out of a cigar box, and nobody seemed to notice that he was ten years old -- David knew he had found his new intellectual home.
