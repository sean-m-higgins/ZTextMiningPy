  The dissenting point of view shared by those few people involved in a different way of thinking about how computers might be used.
  The dissenters shared a vision of personal computing in which computers would be used to enhance the most creative aspects of human intelligence--for everybody, not just the technocognoscenti.
  Those who questioned the dogma of data processing agreed that computers can help us calculate, but they also suspected that if the devices could be made more interactive, these tools might help us to speculate, build and study models, choose between alternatives, and search for meaningful patterns in collections of information.
  They wondered whether this newborn device might become a communication medium as well as a calculating machine.
  These heretical computer theorists proposed that if human knowledge is indeed power, then a device that can help us transform information into knowledge should be the basis for a very powerful technology.
  While most scientists and engineers remained in awe of the giant adding machines, this minority insisted on thinking about how computers might be used to assist the operation of human minds in nonmathematical ways.
  Tools for Thought focuses on the ideas of a few of the people who have been instrumental in creating yesterday's, today's, and tomorrow's human-computer technology.
  Several key figures in the history of computation lived and died centuries or decades ago.
  I call these people, renowned in scientific circles but less known to the public, the patriarchs.
  Other co-creators of personal computer technology are still at work today, continuing to explore the frontiers of mind-machine interaction.
