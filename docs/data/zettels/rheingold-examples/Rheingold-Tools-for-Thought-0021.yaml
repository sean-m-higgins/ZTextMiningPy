  His nit-picking indirectly led Babbage to invent the ancestor of today's computers.
  As a mathematician and astronomer of no small repute, he resented the time he had to spend poring over logarithm tables, culling all the errors he knew were being perpetuated upon him by "elderly Cornish Clergymen, who lived on seven figure logarithms, did all their work by hand, and were only too apt to make mistakes."
  Babbage left a cranky memoir entitled Passages from the Life of a Philosopher--a work described by computer pioneer Herman Goldstine as "a set of papers ranging from the sublime to the ridiculous, from profundities to nonsense in plain bad taste.
  Indeed much of Babbage's career is of this sort.
  It is a wonder that he had as many good and loyal friends when his behavior was so peculiar."
  In Passages, Babbage noted this about the original inspiration for his computing machines: The earliest idea that I can trace in my own mind of calculating arithmetical tables by machinery rose in this manner: One evening I was sitting in the rooms of the Analytical society at Cambridge, my head leaning forward on the table in a kind of dreamy mood, with a Table of logarithms lying open before me.
  Another member, coming into the room, and seeing me half asleep, called out, "Well, Babbage, what are you dreaming about?"
  To which I replied, "I am thinking that all these Tables (pointing to the logarithms) might be calculated by machinery."
  In 1822, Babbage triumphantly demonstrated at the Royal Astronomical Society a small working model of a machine, consisting of cogs and wheels and shafts.
  The device was capable of performing polynomial equations by calculating successive differences between sets of numbers.
