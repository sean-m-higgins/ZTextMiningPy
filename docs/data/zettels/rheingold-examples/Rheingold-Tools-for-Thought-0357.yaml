  The largest market of all is the market for personal power, for new equivalents to opposable thumbs."
  Augmentation visionaries like Engelbart, prophets of interactive computing like Licklider, and infonauts like Alan Kay and Brenda Laurel tend to talk in grand terms about the ultimate effects of what they are doing -- the biggest change since the printing press or even since the opposable thumb.
  They all seem convinced that their projections will be vindicated by a technology that will inevitably come into existence despite the myopia of institutions like SRI, Xerox, and Atari.
  With the increasing power of home computers, and the growing demand for entertainment and educational software, it seems likely that smaller groups, working in entrepreneurial organizations rather than academic or large-scale product-oriented institutions, will produce the fantasy amplifiers and mind augmentors of the near future.
  One of the most controversial areas of entrepreneurial research is in the field of applied artificial intelligence.
  The subject of the next chapter is involved in the commercial development of those intriguing programs that Brenda mentioned, the so-called expert systems that originated in the pure research that is being conducted at MIT and Stanford, and which seem to be invading the world of commercial software.Chapter Thirteen: Knowledge engineers and Epistemological Entrepreneurs ".
  It is extremely important that the development of intelligent machines be pursued, for the human mind is not only limited in its storage and processing capacity but it also has known bugs: It is easily misled, stubborn, and even blind to the truth, especially when pushed to its limits.
  We must find a way of organizing ourselves more effectively, of bringing together the energies of larger groups of people toward a common goal.
  Intelligent systems, built from communications technology, will someday know more than any individual about what is going on in complex enterprises involving millions of people, such as a multinational corporation or a city.
  And they will be able to explain each person's part of the task.
