  We will build more productive factories this way, and maybe someday a more peaceful world.
  We must keep in mind .
  Avron Barr, the author of the statement quoted at the beginning of this chapter, is exploring one of the most potentially explosive areas human-computer evolution -- the field that has come to be known as "knowledge engineering."
  To me, Barr's specialty seems to be rooted in the same ides that goes back to Licklider and Bush -- the inevitability of a human-computer symbiosis.
  But to many other people, the idea of artificial intelligence seems to be fundamentally different from augmentation, in that the artificial intelligentsia appear to be more interested in replacing human intelligence than extending it.
  Knowledge engineering is but one part of that ever-expanding area of hardware and software research that constitutes the field of AI.
  Unlike other artificial intelligence researchers, Avron Barr is not concerned with systems that can direct an optical sensor to recognize visual patterns, or to help a speech-recognition system to understand natural languages, or direct a robot in the task of climbing stairs.
  He and his colleagues are trying to build systems that can transfer knowledge from experts to novices and that can use the transferred knowledge to help people make decisions about specific problems.
  Barr's specialty seems to bridge the gap between those who see the future of computers in terms of "mind tools" and those who see it in terms of "the next step in the evolution of intelligence."
  Like the other people I met who have been involved in building tomorrow's software tools, Barr has a firm belief in the epochal quality of the changes we will face when these experiments filter down to the level of public experience.
