  During the war and afterward, Shannon established the mathematical foundation of information theory.
  Together with cybernetics, this collection of theorems about information and communication created a new way to understand people and machines--and established information as a cosmic fundamental, along with energy and matter.
  The software patriarchs came from wildly different backgrounds.
  Then as now, computer geniuses were often regarded as "odd" by those around them, and their reasons for wanting to invent computing devices seem to have been as varied as their personalities.
  Something about the notion of a universal machine enticed mathematicians and philosophers, logicians and code-breakers, whiz kids and bomb-builders.
  Even today, the worlds of computer research and the software business bring together an unlikely mixture of entrepreneurs and evangelists, futurians and utopians, cultists, obsessives, geniuses, pranksters, and fast-buck artists.
  Despite their outward diversity, the computer patriarchs of a hundred years ago and the cyberneticians if the World War II era appear to have shared at least one characteristic with each other and with software pioneers and infonauts of more recent vintage.
  In recent years, the public has become more aware of a subculture that sprouted in Cambridge and Palo Alto and quietly spread through a national network of fluorescent-lit campus computer centers for the past two decades--the mostly young, mostly male, often brilliant, sometimes bizarre "hackers," or self-confessed compulsive programmers.
  Sociologists and psychologists of the 1980s are only beginning to speculate about the deeper motivation for this obsession, but any later-day hacker will admit that the most fascinating thing in his own life is his own mind, and tell you that he regards intense, prolonged interaction with a computer program as a particularly satisfying kind of dialogue with his own thoughts.
  A little touch of the hacker mentality seems to have affected all of the major players in this story.
