  Can computer programs ("virtual machines") be created that enable computers to write their own software to the specifications of the human user?
  Can the way human brains process information (known in some hard-core AI circles as "wetware") ever be effectively simulated by hardware and software?
  In the summer of 1953, while he was working on these ideas, Shannon hired two temporary laboratory assistants named Minsky and McCarthy, another pair of prodigies who knew some fancy mathematics and thought they could do big things with computers.
  Here were the first members of the first native generation of computer scientists, the ones who already knew about electronics and cybernetics and information theory and brain physiology and were looking for something ambitious to do with it all.
  They ended up in the right place when they dug up Shannon in the midst of Bell Laboratories.
  Shannon had long spoken of his suspicion that the future evolution of more sophisticated computer hardware would make it possible to construct software capable of simulating some parts of human cognition.
  But these younger guys were blatant believers.
  They were out to build an intelligence, and didn't mind saying so.
  McCarthy and Shannon edited a book on automata, and three years later, in 1956, Shannon joined Minsky, McCarthy, and an IBM computer researcher, Nathaniel Rochester, in sponsoring a summer conference at Dartmouth University, to set goals for this new field.
  The new field they gathered to discuss was a branch of science that did not yet have a name, but which was founded on the assumption that the existence of computers now made it possible to consider creating an artificial version of the most complex system known to science -- human intelligence.
