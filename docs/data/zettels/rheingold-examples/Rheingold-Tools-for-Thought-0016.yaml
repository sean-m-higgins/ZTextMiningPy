  Kay, the former quiz kid, is now in his early forties.
  Taylor is in his early fifties, Engelbart in his late fifties, and Licklider in his sixties.
  Today, younger men and, increasingly, younger women, have begun to take over the field professionally, while even younger generations are now living in their own versions of the future for fun, profit, and thrills.
  The ones I call the "infonauts" are the older brothers and sisters of the adolescent hackers you read about in the papers.
  Most of them are in their twenties and thirties.
  They work for themselves or for some research institution or software house, and represent the first members of the McLuhan generation to use the technology invented by the von Neumann generation as tools to extend their imagination.
  From the science of designing what they call the "user interface"--where mind meets machine--to the art of building educational microworlds, the infonauts have been using their new medium to create the mass-media version we will use fifteen years from now.
  Avron Barr is a knowledge engineer who helps build the special computer programs known as expert systems that are apparently able to acquire knowledge from human experts and transfer it to other humans.
  These systems are now used experimentally to help physicians diagnose diseases, as well as commercially to help geologists locate mineral deposits and to aid chemists in identifying new compounds.
  Although philosophers debate whether such programs truly "understand" what they are doing, and psychologists point out the huge gap between the narrowly defined kind of expertise involved in geology or diagnosis and the much more general "world knowledge" that all humans have, there is no denying that expert systems are valuable commodities.
