  Santa Clara Valley was still the world's largest prune orchard, and the electronics industry had only recently moved out of a couple of garages in Palo Alto.
  The drive gave him time to think.
  Ultimately, the kinds of crusades that appealed to him still didn't satisfy his needs: there weren't clear-cut ways of organizing one's thoughts to run a crusade.
  He was an engineer, not a political organizer, and the world was becoming too complicated for anything but the most well-organized crusades.
  Suddenly, Doug recognized that he was running into the same fundamental issue over and over again.
  Engelbart realized, as had Vannevar Bush, that humankind was moving into an era in which the complexity and urgency of global problems were surpassing time-honored tools for dealing with problems.
  He also began to understand, as did Licklider a few years later, that handling the informational by-products of problem-solving had itself become the key to all the other problems.
  The most important task no longer lay in devising new ways to expand our accumulation of knowledge, but in knowing where to look for the answers that were already stored somewhere.
  That was the kind of payoff I wanted, so that's what I set out to do."
