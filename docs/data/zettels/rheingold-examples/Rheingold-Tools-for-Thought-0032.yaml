note: |
  Her argument against artificial intelligence, set forth in her "Observations," was immortalized almost a century later by another software prophet, Alan Turing, who dubbed her line of argument "Lady Lovelace's Objection."
  It is an opinion that is still frequently heard in debates about machine intelligence: "The Analytical Engine," Ada wrote, "has no pretensions whatever to originate anything.
  It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform."
  It is not known how and when Ada became involved in her clandestine and disastrous gambling ventures.
  No evidence has ever been produced that Babbage had anything to do with introducing Ada to what was to be her lifelong secret vice.
  For a time, Lord Lovelace shared Ada's obsession, but after incurring significant losses he stopped.
  She continued, clandestinely.
  Babbage became deeply involved in Ada's gambling toward the end of her life.
  For her part, Ada helped Babbage in more than one scheme to raise money to construct the Analytical Engine.
  It was a curious mixture of vice, high intellectual adventure, and bizarre entrepreneurship.
