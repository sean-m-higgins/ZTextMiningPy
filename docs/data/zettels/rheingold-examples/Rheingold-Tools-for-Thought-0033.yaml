  They built a tic-tac-toe machine, but gave up on it as a moneymaking venture when an adviser assured them that P. T. Barnum's General Tom Thumb had sewn up the market for traveling novelties.
  Ironically, although Babbage's game-playing machines were commercial failures, his theoretical approach created a foundation for the future science of game theory, scooping even that twentieth-century genius John von Neumann by about a hundred years.
  It was Charley and Ada's attempt to develop an infallible system for betting on the ponies that brought Ada to the sorry pass of twice pawning her husband's family jewels, without his knowledge, to pay off blackmailing bookies.
  At one point, Ada and Babbage--never one to turn down a crazy scheme--used the existing small scale working model of the Difference Engine to perform the calculations required by their complex handicapping scheme.
  The calculations were based on sound approaches to the theory of handicapping, but as the artificial intelligentsia were to learn over a century later, even the best modeling programs have trouble handling truly complex systems.
  They lost big.
  To make matters worse, when she compounded her losses Ada had to turn to her mother, who was not the most forgiving soul, to borrow the money to redeem the Lovelace jewels before her husband could learn of their absence.
  Ada died of cancer at the age of thirty-six.
  Babbage outlived her by decades, but without Ada's advice, support, and sometimes stern guidance, he was not able to complete his long-dreamed-of Analytical Engine.
  Because the toolmaking art of his day was not up to the tolerance demanded by his designs, Babbage pioneered the use of diamond-tipped tools in precision-lathing.
