  It allowed room for human vagueness and judgment.
  Instead of forcing the user to divide things into sharp categories, or requiring the data to be precise from the beginning -- all those stiff restrictions people say "the computer requires" -- it let you slide things around to your heart's content.
  You could rearrange till you got what you wanted, no matter for what reason you wanted it.
  There had been lightpens and graphical computer screens before, used in the military, but Sketchpad was historic in its simplicity -- a simplicity, it must be added, that had been deliberately crafted by a cunning intellect -- and its lack of involvement with any particular field.
  Indeed, it lacked any complications normally tangled with what people actually do.
  It was, in short, an innocent program, showing how easy human work could be if a computer were set up to be really helpful.
  As described here, this may not seem very useful, and that has been part of the problem.
  Sketchpad was a very imaginative, novel program, in which Sutherland invented a lot of new techniques; and it takes imaginative people to see its meaning.
  Admittedly the rabbits and rockets are a frivolous example, suited only to a science-fiction convention at Easter.
  But many other applications are obvious: this would do so much for blueprints, or electronic diagrams, or other areas where large and precise drafting is needed.
