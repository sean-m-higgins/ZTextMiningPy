  The little girl recovered.
  The doctor, the pathologist, and the child's family were grateful.
  The specialist, a computer program named MYCIN residing in a mainframe computer at Stanford Medical Center, chalked up another diagnostic triumph to its already impressive record.
  Although this particular story is fictional, the dialogue is an excerpt from a real MYCIN consultation.
  The program does indeed exist, and is in use as a strictly experimental diagnostic assistant.
  It is an example of a whole range of new computer programs known as expert systems that are now serving as intelligent assistants to human experts in fields as diverse as medicine and geology, mathematics and molecular biology, computer design and organic chemistry.
  Expert systems are just the first of a whole new variety of software probes that infonauts like Avron Barr are launching into the unknown regions of human-machine relationships.
  These systems are both research tools and commercial products.
  A program called PROSPECTOR has recently helped pinpoint a molybdenum deposit worth tens of millions of dollars.
  A program named DENDRAL, which started out as an artificial intelligence experiment, is now owned by a consortium of chemical companies, whose chemists use it to design and synthesize potentially useful new compounds.
