  The bootstrapping and readjusting continued with unabated enthusiasm, at least until the early 1970s, when the idea of building a system that was meant to "transcend itself every six to eight months" to keep pace with hardware and software advances turned out to be more pleasant to contemplate than to carry out.
  It had been a challenging and exhilarating to build this new system for augmenting thought -- but it wasn't as much fun having one's work habits augmented at a forced-march pace.
  When both the old-timers and newcomers to the growing project faced the task of learning new roles, changing old attitudes, adopting different methods, on regular basis, just because the system enabled them to do so, the great adventure became more arduous than any of the ARC pioneers/experimental subjects had anticipated.
  So a psychologist was brought in to consult about those parts of the system that weren't found in the circuitry or software, but in the thoughts and relationships of the people who were building and using the system.
  Dr. James Fadiman joined ARC as an observer-catalyst-therapist.
  Fadiman was particularly interested in the ways human consciousness and behavior change in new situations, and it didn't take him long to realize that the process of "being augmented" was in fact a new, nonchemical form of altered consciousness.
  Several of the things Fadiman learned about the "augmentation experience" have taken more than a decade to filter out to people who design computers for nonexperts.
  One thing he learned almost immediately was that most people resist change, especially in the workplace, and resistance works both ways -- people who are resistant to learning an augmentation system are equally resistant to giving it up once they have adopted it.
  The initial resistance is partially grounded in a general fear of the unknown.
  Doug Engelbart, of course, saw these things on his own scale, and through the eyes of an engineer.
