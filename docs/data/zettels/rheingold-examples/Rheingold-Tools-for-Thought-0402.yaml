note: |
  Libertarian ideas of accessibility and excitement might unseat the video narcosis that now sits on our land like a fog.
  I want to see the writings of Herodotus, Nostradamus, and Matthew Brann as accessible as those of Rod McKuen, along with the art of the renaissance and movies of tomorrow -- an all-encompassing picture-book encyclopedia tumult graffiti-land, the Whole Works.
  If this all seems like a wild idea, that means you understand it.
  These are times wild with possibility.
  In an age of pocket calculators, the Pill, hydrogen bombs by rocket, and soap operas by satellite, we can try to create whatever wildness we want in our society.
  I say these worlds are possible soon.
  We need them, and they will make lots of money.
  The software is on the way.
  But what is really lacking are the visionary artists, writers, publishers, and investors who can see the possibilities and help carry such ideas into reality.
  What Nelson is raving about is not a technology, but a community.
