  A less modest man might not have been able to bring himself to face the conclusion: Licklider decided, on the basis of his informal self-study, that most of the tasks that take up the time of any technical thinker would be performed more effectively by machines.
  This was a thought that was occurring to one or two other people at about the same time -- notably Doug Engelbart, out in California.
  But because of his association with certain military-sponsored research projects at MIT in the 1950s, there was an important difference between Licklider and the others who dreamed of converting computers into some kind of mind-amplifying tool.
  This crucial difference was the fact that Licklider had reached his conclusion not long before circumstances put him at the center of power in the one institution capable of sponsoring the creation of an entire new technology.
  At that point in the history of computer technology -- a field in which Licklider had been only tangentially involved until then -- no respectable computer scientist would dare suggest that computer technology ought to be totally revamped so that scientists could use these machines to help keep track of data and build theoretical models of the phenomena they were studying.
  To those who were wild enough to make such a suggestion -- especially the young MIT computer mavericks who were founding the field of artificial intelligence around that time -- the idea might have seemed too obvious and too trivial to pursue.
  In any case, the AI founders were more interested in replacing the scientist than the scientist's file clerk.
  Licklider, however, was neither a respectable computer scientist nor a computer maverick, but a psychologist with some expertise in electronics.
  And like any other competent investigator, he followed where the data led him.
  In the late 1950s, Licklider had no real expertise in digital computer design, and although he knew that only a computer could give him what he needed, he didn't think that the kinds of computers then available, and the kinds of things they did, were suitable for building a sort of "electronic file clerk."
