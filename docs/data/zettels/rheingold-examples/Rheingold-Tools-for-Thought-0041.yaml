  But mathematicians have found that Boole's mathematical logic is much more important to the foundation of their enterprise than they first suspected.
  And the inventors of the first computers learned that a simple system with only two values can weave very sophisticated computations indeed.
  The construction of a theoretical bridge between mathematics and logic had been gloriously begun, but was far from completed by Boole's work.
  It remained for later minds to discover that although it is probably not true that the human mind resembles a machine, there is still great power to be gained by thinking about machines that resemble the operations of the mind.
  Nineteenth-century technology simply wasn't precise enough, fast enough, or powerful enough for ideas like those of Babbage, Lovelace, and Boole to become practicalities.
  The basic science and the industrial capabilities needed for making several of the most important components of modern computers simply didn't exist.
  There were still important problems that would have to be solved by the inventors rather than the theorists.
  The next important development in the history of computation, and the last important contribution of the nineteenth century, had nothing to do with calculating tables of logarithms or devising laws of thought.
  The next thinker to advance the state of the art was Herman Hollerith, a nineteen-year-old employee of the United States Census Office.
  His role would have no effect on the important theoretical foundations of computing.
