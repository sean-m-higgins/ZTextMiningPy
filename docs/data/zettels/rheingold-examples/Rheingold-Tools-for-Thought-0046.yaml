  It wasn't even a blueprint.
  The digital computer was conceived as a symbol system--the first automatic symbol system --not as a tool or a weapon.
  And the person who invented it was not concerned with ballistics or calculation, but with the nature of thought and the nature of machines.Chapter Three: The First Hacker and His Imaginary Machine Throughout the winter of 1936, a young Cambridge don put the finishing touches on a highly technical paper about mathematical logic that he didn't expect more than a dozen people around the world to understand.
  It was an unusual presentation, not entirely orthodox by the rather rigid standards of his colleagues.
  The young man wasn't entirely orthodox, himself.
  Although his speech revealed his upper-middle class origins, his manner of dress, his erratic grooming, and his grating voice put off most of his peers.
  An outsider to the loftier academic-social circles of the university, he had few friends, preferring to spend his time at mathematics, chemistry experiments, chess puzzles, and long runs in the countryside.Computation, when it was finally invented, a century after Babbage, did not come in the form of some new gadget in an inventor's workshop or a scientist's laboratory.
  The very possibility of building digital computers was given to the world in the form of an esoteric paper in a mathematics journal in 1936.
  Nobody realized at the time that this peculiar discovery in the obscure field of metamathematics would eventually lead to a world-changing technology, although the young author, Alan Mathison Turing, knew he was on the track of machines that could simulate the human thought processes.
  That mathematics paper was a pivotal point in the cultural history of Western civilization.
