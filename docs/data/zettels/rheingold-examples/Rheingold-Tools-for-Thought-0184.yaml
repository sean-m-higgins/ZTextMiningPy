  The result was that university laboratories and think tanks around the country began to work on the components of a system that would depend on engineering and software breakthroughs that hadn't been achieved yet.
  The time-sharing experience turned out to be a cultural as well as a technological watershed.
  As Licklider had predicted, these new tools changed the way information was processed, but they also changed the way people thought.
  A lot of researchers who were to later participate in the creation of personal computer technology got their first experience in the high-pressure art and science of interactive computer design in the first ARPA-funded time-sharing projects.
  One of the obstacles to achieving the kind of interactive computing that Licklider and his growing cadre of "converts" envisioned lay in the slowness and low capacity of the memory component of 1950-style computers; this hardware problem was solved when Jay Forrester, director of the Whirlwind project, came up with "magnetic core memory."
  The advent of transistorized computers promised even greater memory capacity and faster access time in the near future.
  A different problem, characterized by the batch-processing bottleneck, stemmed from the way computers were set up to accept input from human operators; a combination of hardware and software innovations were converging on direct keyboard-to-computer input.
  Another one of the obstacles to achieving the overall goal of interactive computing lay not in the way computer processed information -- an issue that was addressed by the time-sharing effort -- but the primitive way computers were set up to display information to human operators.
  Lincoln Laboratory was the natural place to concentrate the graphics effort.
  Another graphics-focused group was started at the University of Utah.
