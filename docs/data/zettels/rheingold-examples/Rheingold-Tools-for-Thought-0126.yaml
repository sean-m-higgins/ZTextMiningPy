  Information about the distance from the hand to the pencil, as seen by the eye, is fed back to the muscles controlling the hand.
  Similarly, the position of the gun and the position of the target as sensed by radar are fed back to the automatic aiming device.
  The MIT team had wondered whether someone more informed about neurophysiology had come across analogous mathematics of pencil pushing, with similar results.
  As it happened, there was another team that, like Wiener and Bigelow, was made up of one infant prodigy and one slightly older genius, by the names of Pitts and McCulloch respectively, who were coming down exactly the same trail from the other direction.
  A convergence of ideas that was both forced and fortuitous, related to but distinctly different from the convergence on digital computation, was taking place under the pressure of war.
  Even von Neumann was due to get into the act, as Wiener wanted him to do -- Wiener persuaded MIT to try to outbid Princeton for von Neumann's attentions after the war.
  Politically, militarily, and scientifically, Wiener's corner of the plot was getting thick.
  The antiaircraft problem, the possible explanations for how brain cells work, the construction of digital computers, the decoding of messages from noise -- all these seemingly unrelated problems were woven together when the leading characters were brought together by the war.
  The founding of the interdisciplinary study that was later named cybernetics came about when Wiener and Bigelow wondered whether any processes in the human body corresponded to the problem of excessive feedback in servomechanisms.
  They appealed to an authority on physiology, from the Instituto Nacional de Cardologa in Mexico City.
