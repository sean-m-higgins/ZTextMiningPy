  You could, indeed, save numerous pictures in this way.
  For example, you could make a picture of a rabbit and a picture of a rocket, and then put little rabbits all over a large rocket.
  Or, little rockets all over a large rabbit.
  The screen on which the picture appeared did not necessarily show all the details; the important thing was that the details were in the computer; when you magnified a picture sufficiently, they would come into view.
  You could magnify and shrink a picture to a spectacular degree.
  You could fill a rocket picture with rabbit pictures, then shrink that until all that was visible was a tiny rocket; then you could make copies of that, and dot them all over a large copy of the rabbit picture.
  So that when you expanded the big rabbit till only a small part showed (so it would be the size of a house, if the screen were large enough), then the foot-long rockets on the screen would each have rabbits the size of a dime.
  Finally, if you changed the master picture -- say, by putting a third ear on the big rabbit -- all the copies would change correspondingly.
  Thus Sketchpad let you try things out before deciding.
  Instead of making you position a line in one specific way, it was set up to allow you to a number of different positions and arrangements, with the ease of moving cut-outs around on a table.
