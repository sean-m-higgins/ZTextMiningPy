note: |
  From what we know today about the patriarchs and pioneers, they all appear to have pursued a vision of a new way to use their minds.
  Each of them was trying to create a mental lever.
  Each of them contributed indispensable components of the device that was eventually assembled.
  But none of them encompassed it all.
  The history of computation became increasingly complex as it progressed from the patriarchs to the pioneers.
  At the beginning, many of the earliest computer scientists didn't know that their ideas would end up in a kind of machine.
  Almost all of them worked in isolation.
  Because of their isolation from one another, the common intellectual ancestors of the modern computer are relatively easy to discern in retrospect.
  But since the 1950s, with the proliferation of researchers and teams of researchers in academic, industrial, and military institutions, the branches of the history have become tangled and too numerous to describe exhaustively.
  Since the 1950s, it has become increasingly difficult to assign credit for computer breakthroughs to individual inventors.
