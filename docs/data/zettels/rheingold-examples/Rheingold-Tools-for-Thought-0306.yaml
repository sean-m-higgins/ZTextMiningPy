  I get shivers now thinking of it.
  It rotated my point of view through a different dimension and nothing has been the same since.
  I suddenly understood the purpose of higher level languages.
  Alan was one of the enthralled audience at Engelbart's 1968 media show.
  He was excited by it because it demonstrated what you could really do with a computer augmented representation system.
  It also made it clear to Alan what he didn't want to do.
  They had almost instant response -- like a very good video game.
  You could pilot your way through immense fields of information.
  It was, unfortunately for my purposes, something elegant and elaborate that these experts had learned how to play.
  It was too complex for my tastes, and I wasn't interested in the whole notion of literacy as a kind of fluency.
