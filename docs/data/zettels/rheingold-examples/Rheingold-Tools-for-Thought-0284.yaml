  It was the first machine designed to put significant computing power on a person's desk.
  The job the Alto designers did was all the more remarkable when compared with the first "personal computers" the outside world was to learn about years later.
  The 1975 Altair, the granddaddy of the homebrew computers, had all of 1/4K main memory (also known as RAM, this represents the amount of storage space the computer devotes to "working memory," and thus indicates the rough limit of how much work it can do with reasonable speed).
  The first Apple models sold, in 1977, had 8K.
  When IBM introduced its personal computer, in 1981, the standard model had 16K.
  The Alto, in 1974, started with 64K and was soon upgraded to 256K.
  The distinctive bit-mapped screen and the mouse pointing device weren't to be seen on a non-Xerox product until 1983, when Apple produced Lisa.
  The hardware, of course, was just a part of the story.
  These devices were built for the people whose job it was to create equally spectacular software innovations.
  And the personal computers themselves weren't enough for those who longed for the kind of community they had known with the ARPAnet.
