  The first of these questions asked whether or not mathematics was complete.
  Completeness, in the technical sense used by mathematicians, means that every true mathematical statement can be proven (i.e., is the last line of a valid proof).
  The second question, the one that most concerned von Neumann, asked whether mathematics (or any other formal system) was consistent.
  Consistency in the technical sense means that there is no valid sequence of allowable steps (or "moves" or "states") that could prove an untrue statement to be true.
  If arithmetic was a consistent system, there would never be a way to prove that 1 + 1 = 3.
  The third question, the one that opened the side door to computation, asked whether or not mathematics was decidable.
  Decidability means that there is some definite method that is guaranteed to correctly determine whether an assertion is provable.
  It didn't take long for a shocking answer to emerge in response to the first Hilbert-von Neumann question.
  In 1930, yet another young mathematician, Kurt Gdel, showed that arithmetic cannot be complete, because there will always be at least one true assertion that cannot be proved.
  In the course of demonstrating this, Gdel crossed a crucial threshold between logic and mathematics when he showed that any formal system that is as rich as the number system (i.e., contains the mathematical operators + and =) can be expressed in terms of arithmetic.
