note: |
  Memoranda were written, as they are on any project, without the least expectation that years later they would be regarded as historical or legal documents.
  Technology was moving too fast for the traditional process of peer review and publication: the two most important documents from these early days were titled "First Draft .
  By the time they got around to sketching the design for the next electronic computer, the four main ENIAC designers had agreed that the goal was to design a machine that would use the same hardware technology in a more efficient way.
  The next step, the invention of stored programming, is where the accreditation controversy comes in.
  At the end of June, 1945, the ENIAC team prepared a proposal in the form of a "First Draft of a Report on the Electronic Discrete Variable Calculator" (EDVAC).
  It was signed by von Neumann, but reflected the conclusions of the group.
  Goldstine later said of this: "It has been said by some that von Neumann did not give credits in his First Draft to others.
  The reason for this was that the document was intended by von Neumann as a working paper for use in clarifying and coordinating the thinking of the group and was not intended for publication."
  The most significant innovations articulated in this paper involved the logical aspects of coding, as well as dealing with the engineering of the physical device that was to follow the coded instructions.
  Creating the coded instructions for a new computation on ENIAC was nowhere near as time consuming as carrying out the calculation by hand.
