  The true value of books emerged from the community they made possible, an intellectual community that is still alive all over the world.
  The printed page has been a medium for the propagation of ideas about chemistry and poetry, evolution and revolution, democracy and psychology, technology and industry, and many other notions beyond the ken of the people who invented movable type and started cranking out Bibles.
  Because mass production of sophisticated electronic devices can lag ten years or more behind the state of the art in research prototypes, the first effects of the astonishing achievements in computer science since 1960 have only begun to enter our lives.
  Word processors, video games, educational software, and computer graphics were unknown terms to most people only ten years ago, but today they are the names for billion-dollar industries.
  And the experts agree that the most startling developments are yet to come.
  A few of the pioneers of personal computing who still work in the computer industry can remember the birth and the dream, when the notion of personal computing was an obscure heresy in the ranks of the computing priesthood.
  Thirty years ago, the overwhelming majority of the people who designed, manufactured, programmed, and used computers subscribed to a single idea about the proper (and possible) place of computers in society: "computers are mysterious devices meant to be used in mathematical calculations."
  Period.
  Computer technology was believed to be too fragile, valuable, and complicated for nonspecialists.
  In 1950 you could count the people who took exception to this dogma on the fingers of one hand.
