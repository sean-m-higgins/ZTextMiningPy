  Weizenbaum was so horrified that he started rethinking everything he believed.
  But that was just a symptom of how gullible we all might be to what he knew was just a clever hack.
  More serious, to Weizenbaum's way of thinking, was the fact that Colby and others thought that "computer-therapists" might soon be applied to some form of "automatic psychotherapy" -- an idea Weizenbaum considered "obscene."
  Weizenbaum's ethical debate, although it originated in the same laboratory that spawned so many important innovations in AI and computer systems design, will not be discussed at length here.
  His books and the ideas expressed by Weizenbaum and his critics deserve consideration on their own accord.
  David Rodman was one of those who spent time conversing with ELIZA when it was still in its infancy, while he was employed as a research assistant in the same laboratory.
  Some of David's earliest LISP hacks were attempts to emulate ELIZA.
  And although Weizenbaum didn't know it, some of David's early acid trips were spent in "conversation" with ELIZA.
  While Minsky was a kind of patron saint of hackdom, and Greenblatt was an unkempt hero, and McCarthy had his own brand of AI prodigies, Weizenbaum was not very fond of some of the hackers who shared his working quarters, to put it mildly.
  In his book, he mounted a direct assault on the inner circle of hard-core hackers: Wherever computer centers have become established, that is to say, in countless places in the United States, as well as in virtually all other industrial regions of the world, bright young men of disheveled appearance, often with sunken glowing eyes, can be seen sitting at computer consoles, their arms tensed waiting to fire, their fingers, already poised to strike at the buttons and keys on which their attention seems to be as riveted as a gambler's on the rolling dice.
