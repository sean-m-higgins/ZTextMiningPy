  And every attempt clarifies our understanding of what it means to fly.
  But there is more to the sciences of the artificial than defining the "true nature" of natural phenomena.
  The exploration of the artifacts themselves, the stiff-winged flying machines, because they are useful to society, will naturally extend the exploration of the various points of interface between the technology and society.
  While nature's explorations of the possibilities is limited by its mutation mechanism, human inventors will vary every parameter they can think of to produce effects that might be useful -- exploring the constraints on the design of their machines from every angle.
  The space of "flight" phenomena will be populated by examples that nature has not had a chance to try.
  Intelligence, like flight, is a way of dealing with the environment.
  Intelligence, again like flight, conveys a survival advantage to the organism or species that possesses it.
  The sheer usefulness, the practical value to society of being able to fly from place to place ensured better artificial ways to fly.
  Barr suggests that expert systems and other knowledge-based technologies are the kind of "flying machines of the mind" that will have an equally high utilitarian value, and the economics of the marketplace will therefore drive the future exploration of their capabilities.
  The "applied" part of "applied AI" is one of the most significant aspects of expert systems, in Barr's opinion, because the linkage of intelligent systems with valuable social goals guarantees the further development of the young science.
