note: |
  All the screen and speakers do is to establish an environment.
  Once I look around the environment, however, I want to interact with it.
  Say it's a planet that I'm exploring for the United Federation of Planets.
  I start walking through this world.
  Today, with the state of the interface art as it is, if I want to move to the north and turn over a stone, I'd tell the computer, 'Move north.
  Turn stone.'
  Note that I have to tell the computer.
  I've just stepped out of the fantasy.
  And you destroy a fantasy when you step out of it.
  I don't think it's just a question of making the environment lifelike.
