  He also declared that we would soon be faced with important decisions about what computers ought and ought not to do.
  He specifically cited the hackers as a symptom of a sickness in the heart of computerdom.
  Weizenbaum's assault on some of the most fundamental premises of the computer culture with the 1976 publication of Computer Power and Human Reason set off a continuing, oft-heated public debate between Weizenbaum and the AI community.
  The Dreyfus-AI debate had been largely a technical argument, which helped make MacHack's technical victory so sweet.
  Weizenbaum's was a moral argument, and it carried a passionate force far different in effect from that of Hubert Dreyfus, flying in from California with his phenomenology.
  This was Joseph Weizenbaum, honored professor of computer science at MIT, saying that AI might not be a crock, but we better be a lot more careful with computers, and watch out for the hackers in the process.
  Remember when those funny-looking "computer letters" started appearing on the bottom of checks, in the early 1960s?
  That was part of Joseph Weizenbaum's work in the days before he came to MIT.
  As a software expert for General Electric, he was centrally involved in Bank of America's ERMA project, a milestone in the computerization of the world's banking system.
  When Weizenbaum later spoke about the morality of using computers in ways that might change millions of people's lives, he was speaking from experience.
