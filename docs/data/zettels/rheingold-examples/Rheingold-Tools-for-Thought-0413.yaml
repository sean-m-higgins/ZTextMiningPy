note: |
  I work out of my 1984 Electronic Cottage with a variety of microcomputer and telecommunications tools.
  I am a happily married middle-aged family man who has seen enough of Big Government, Big Industry, Big political Causes -- either of the left or the right -- to now prefer to operate a small business out of a small house, in a small neighborhood, working with small organizations, using a small computer to make it all possible.
  I also have a small computer bulletin-board to link my local friends with my brain -- asychronously and in the noble written form of English.
  Dave has opinions and poems and stories to tell.
  He teaches classes via modem to students around the world.
  And all subscribers can read what he has to say, at their own expense, and reply by electronic mail if they wish, also at their own expense.
  The other electronic magazine I sampled, Mylar's Warp, an Electronic Serial, by Floyd Flanagan, was strictly fictional.
  The idea is the same idea behind any serial -- the writer has to keep it interesting in order to keep the readers' attention.
  The title of Chapter 1 was "Reflections on Ice," and this is as much as I read before I realized how much I was spending in connect time: I know I'm freezing to death.
  Wasn't supposed to feel a thing.
