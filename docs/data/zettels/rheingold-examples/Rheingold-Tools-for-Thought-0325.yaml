  A "musical score capture system" called OPUS and a graphic animation tool called SHAZAM were part of the Smalltalk-Dynabook toolkit.
  In 1977, Scientific American's annual theme edition was dedicated to the subject of "Microelectronics."
  Alan Kay's contribution to the issue, "Microlectronics and the Personal Computer," was the only article that directly talked about the meaning of this new technology for people.
  The magazine's editors summed up the piece in a two-sentence subtitle: "Rates of progress in microlectronics suggest that in about a decade many people will possess a notebook-sized computer with the capacity of a large computer of today.
  What might such a system do for them?"
  One of the first things Kay pointed out was the connection between the use of interactive graphic tools and the exercise of a new cognitive skill -- a skill at selecting new ways to view the world.
  The metamedium which Kay still saw to be a decade in the future would only achieve its full power when people use it enough to see what it is about.
  The power that the 1977 prototypes granted to the human who used such devices was the power to create many new points of view.
  This freedom to change one's view of a microworld, Kay believed, was one of the most important powers of the new kinds of representational tools that were being designed and tested in the late 1970s.
  In describing the way children learned to use the Smalltalk system, Kay also described something of the nature of the experience: Initially the children interact with our computer by "painting" pictures and drawing straight lines on the display screen with the pencillike pointer.
