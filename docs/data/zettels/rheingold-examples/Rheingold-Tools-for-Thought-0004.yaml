  I call them the pioneers.
  The youngest generation, the ones who are exploring the cognitive domains we will all soon experience, I call the Infonauts.
  It is too early to tell what history will think of the newer ideas, but we're going to take a look at some of the things the latest inner-space explorers are thinking, in hopes of catching some clues to what (and how) everybody will be thinking in the near future.
  As we shall see, the future limits of this technology are not in the hardware but in our minds.
  The digital computer is based upon a theoretical discovery known as "the universal machine," which is not actually a tangible device but a mathematical description of a machine capable of simulating the actions of any other machine.
  Once you have created a general-purpose machine that can imitate any other machine, the future development of the tool depends only on what tasks you can think to do with it.
  For the immediate future, the issue of whether machines can become intelligent is less important than learning to deal with a device that can become whatever we clearly imagine it to be.
  The pivotal difference between today's personal computers and tomorrow's intelligent devices will have less to do with their hardware than their software-- the instructions people create to control the operations of the computing machinery.
  A program is what tells the general-purpose machine to imitate a specific kind of machine.
  Just as the hardware basis for computing has evolved from relays to vacuum tubes to transistors to integrated circuits, the programs have evolved as well.
