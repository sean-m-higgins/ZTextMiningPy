  He worked as a professional jazz and rock guitarist for ten years.
  When it looked like he was about to be drafted, Kay joined the U.S. Air Force as a navigational cadet.
  In the Air Force, he "wore out a pair of shoes doing insubordination duty," but he also learned that he had a knack for computer programming.
  After he finished his Air Force duty, the National Center for Atmospheric Research was eager to use Kay's programming talent to pay his way through the University of Colorado.
  He earned a degree in biology, but his college grades were as mixed as they had always been, because of his habit of concentrating intently on only those things that interested him.
  Through what Alan now calls "sheer luck," he came to the attention of somebody smart enough to actually teach something to a smartass like Alan Kay -- and bold enough to admit a student with an undergraduate record that read more like a rap sheet than a transcript.
  The man who gambled on Kay's checkered history in academia was David Evans, the chairman of the computer science department at the University of Utah, a place that was to become one of the centers of the augmentation community by the mid-1960s.
  Like so many others who assumed positions of leadership in the field of interactive computer systems design, Evans had been involved in early commercial computer research and with the ARPA-funded groups that created time-sharing.
  People frequently migrated back and forth from one ARPA project or another.
  ARPA funded people rather than projects, and they didn't meddle for an extended period.
