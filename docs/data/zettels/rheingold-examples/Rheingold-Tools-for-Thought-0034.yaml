  In order to systematize the production of components for his Engine, he devised methods to mass-manufacture interchangeable parts and wrote a classic treatise on what has since become known as "mass production."
  Babbage wrote books of varying degrees of coherence, made breakthroughs in some sciences and failed in others, gave brilliant and renowned dinner parties with guests like Charles Darwin, and seems to have ended up totally embittered.
  Bowden noted that "Shortly before Babbage died he told a friend that he could not remember a single completely happy day in his life: 'He spoke as if he hated mankind in general, Englishmen in particular, and the English Government and Organ Grinders most of all.'"
  While Ada Lovelace has been unofficially known to the inner circles of programmers since the 1950s, when card-punched batch-processing was not altogether different from Ada's kind of programming, she has been relatively unknown outside those circles until recently.
  In the 1970s, the U.S. Department of defense officially named its "superlanguage" after her.George Boole Although it came too late to assist in the original design of the Analytical Engine, yet another discovery that was to later become essential to the construction of computers was made by a contemporary of Babbage and Lovelace.
  The creation of an algebra of symbolic logic was the work of another mathematical prodigy and British individualist, but one who worked and lived in a different world, far away from the parlors of upper-class London.
  A seventeen-year-old Englishman by the name of George Boole was struck by an astonishing revelation while walking across a meadow one day in 1832.
  The idea came so suddenly, and made such a deep impact on his life, that it led Boole to make pioneering if obscure speculations about a heretofore unsuspected human facility that he called "the unconscious."
  Boole's contribution to human knowledge was not to be in the field of psychology, however, but in a field of his own devising.
  As Bertrand Russell remarked seventy years later, Boole invented pure mathematics.
