  In his conversations, lectures, and writing, Barr often refers to what he and other cognitively oriented computer scientists call "the flight metaphor."
  Early AI researchers, who were seeking pragmatic means to deal with the question of whether machines could think, compared themselves to those human inventors who not so long ago believed they would eventually build flying machines: "Today, despite our ignorance, we can point to that biological milestone, the thinking brain, in the same spirit as the scientists many hundreds of years ago pointed to the bird as a demonstration in nature that mechanisms heavier than air could fly," wrote Feigenbaum and Feldman in 1963.
  If we start to study flight by examining its forms in nature, our initial understanding of what we are studying might involve terms like feathers, wings, weight-to-wing-size ratios, and probably wing flapping, too.
  This is the language we begin to develop -- identifying regularities and making distinctions among the phenomena.
  But when we start to build flying artifacts, our understanding changes immediately.
  Barr then cited another contributor to the flight metaphor, Seymour Papert of MIT, Project MAC, and LOGO fame, who pointed out that the most significant insights into aerodynamics occurred when inventors stopped thinking so extensively about how birds flew.
  Papert stated to a 1972 European seminar attended by Barr: "Consider how people came to understand how birds fly.
  Certainly we observed birds.
  But mainly to recognize certain phenomena.
  Real understanding of bird flight came from understanding flight; not birds."
