  But a personal interactive computer, helpful as such a device might be to a mind such as von Neumann's, was not an interesting enough problem.
  After solving interesting problems about the processes that take place in the heart of stars, a scientific-technological tour de force that also became a historical point of no return when the scientists' employers demonstrated their creation at Hiroshima, and then solving another set of problems concerned with the creation of computing machinery, all the while pontificating about the most potent aspects of foreign policy to the leaders of the most powerful nation in history, John von Neumann was aiming for nothing less than the biggest secret of all.
  In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the most interesting scientific question of the day was "what is life?"
  To someone who had been at Alamogordo and the Moore School, it would not have been too farfetched to believe that the next intellectual conquest might bring the secret of physical immortality within reach.
  Certainly he would never know whether he could truly resolve the most awesome of nature's mysteries until he set his mind to decoding the secret of life.
  And that he did.
  Characteristically, von Neumann focused on the aspect of the mystery of life that appealed to his dearest instincts and most powerful capacities -- the pure, logical, mathematical underpinnings of nature's code.
  He was particularly interested in the logical properties of the theoretical devices known as automata, of which Turing's machine was an example.
  Von Neumann was especially drawn to the idea of self-reproducing automata -- mathematical patterns in space and time that had the property of being able to reproduce themselves.
  He was able to draw on his knowledge of computers, his growing understanding of neurophysiology and biology, and make particularly good use of his deep understanding of logic, because he saw self-replicating automata as essentially logical beasts.
