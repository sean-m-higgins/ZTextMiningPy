  The most difficult barrier faced by the first designers of artificial aviation was not in the environmental obstacles their inventions faced, nor in the nature of the materials and techniques they had available, but in their ideas of what flight could and could not be.
  The undeniable proof of the simple but incredible idea that flight does not require flapping wings was the most important thing achieved by the Wright brothers.
  At the turn of the century, a fundamental part of the problem facing aviation designers lay in abandoning prejudices about the way things actually were so that the possible might be discerned.
  Those who wanted to build flying machines had to abandon their fixation with the way nature solved the problem of evolving a flying lifeform so that they might see beyond birds to understand the nature of flight.
  In the same sense, a fundamental part of the problem of artificial intelligence design lies in the ability to see beyond brains or computers to understand something about the nature of intelligence.
  Cognitive scientists know that such knowledge can shed light on the way human brains work.
  Barr points out that such knowledge might expand into varieties of intelligence as different from human intelligence as a jet plane is different from an eagle.
  If the flight metaphor could be faithfully extrapolated to the artificers of thinking machines and engineers of programs that understand, Barr claims, new worlds of unimaginable information processing mechanisms would become possible -- mechanisms that would be compatible but quite different from the way human brains do things: .
  Every new design brings new data about what works and what does not, and clues as to why.
  Every new contraption tries some different design alternative in the space defined by our theory language.
