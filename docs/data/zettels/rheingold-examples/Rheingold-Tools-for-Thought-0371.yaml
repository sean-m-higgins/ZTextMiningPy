  The tweedy old fellow buttering a scone at the next table looked like a central-casting stereotype of a Nobel laureate.
  Barr was wearing a white shirt and tie when we met.
  He appears to be in his midthirties.
  His hair is brown and well-groomed, his moustache neatly trimmed -- another one of the many babyboomers who might have been hippies in the sixties, but who now go to hairstylists twice a month.
  He looks like the young man who used to put your groceries in the bag.
  Barr got into programming in the first place because he needed a job, and he became involved with artificial intelligence because AI programmers seemed to have the only tools he could find that were capable of helping him to create the kind of programs he needed in his work for a research team.
  His need for a job came after he dropped out of graduate school.
  His undergraduate work in physics and math at Cornell led to Berkeley, in 1971, where a few months as a physics graduate student made it clear to him that he really didn't want to be a physicist, after all.
  At that point, a career in computer science wasn't even on his list of goals, but programming happened to be one of his marketable skills -- he had worked his way through Cornell doing scientific programming for various faculty members, stumbling along in FORTRAN, which he taught himself from a book one weekend.
  After he abandoned his physics career and he began to look for employment, an announcement for a research associate with programming experience came to his attention.
