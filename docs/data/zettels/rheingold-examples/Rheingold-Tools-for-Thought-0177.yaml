  Other answers came from specialists in human perception (like Licklider), who devised new ways for computers to present information to people.
  With the exception of the small crew of the earlier Whirlwind project, SAGE operators were the first computer users who were able to see information on visual display screens; moreover, operators were able to use devices called "lightpens" to alter the graphic displays by touching the screens.
  There was even a primitive decision-making capacity built into the system: the computer could suggest alternate courses of action, based on its model of the developing situation.
  The matter of display screens began to stray away from electronics and into the area of human perception and cognition which was Licklider's cue to join the computer builders.
  But even before Lincoln Laboratory was established in 1953-1954, Licklider had been consulted about the possibility of developing a new technology for displaying computer information to human operators for the purpose of improving air defense capabilities.
  Undoubtedly, the seeds of his future ideas about human-computer symbiosis were first planted when he and other members of what was then called "the presentation group" considered the kinds of visual displays air defense command centers would need.
  The presentation group was where he first became acquainted with Wesley Clark, one of MIT's foremost computer builders.
  Clark had been a principle designer of Whirlwind, the most advanced computer system to precede the SAGE project.
  Whirlwind, the purpose of which was to act as a kind of flight simulator, was in many ways the first hardware ancestor of the personal computer, because it was designed to be operated by a single "test pilot."
  It was also used for modeling aerodynamic equations.
