  Another project in the late seventies used a modification of Engelbart's NLS system to enable EIES subscribers in one experimental group to quickly browse through time-sensitive technical information.
  By 1978, policy-makers, artists, long-range planners, and others began to join EIES.
  Roxanne Hiltz and Turoff published a book that year, entitled Network Nation, in which they predicted that the medium wouldn't be limited to a few laboratories and think tanks.
  They noted that any microcomputer with a modem and appropriate software could plug into any network its user knew how to enter.
  They saw the development of easier-to-use, population-wide teleconferencing networks as a means of reducing the distance between people's minds and thoughts, as a forum for intellectual discourse and group decision-making, as a model for a new kind of community where one's age, gender, race, or physical appearance would no longer matter as much as what one has to say.
  By the early 1980s, personal computers were being sold by the millions, and some of the people who bought them wanted to plug into these networks they were beginning to hear about.
  EIES has always been something of an elite -- you have to apply and pay a relatively high fee.
  But the first public information utility wasn't long in coming.
  In June, 1979, the Telecomputing Corporation of America opened for business out of a host computer in McLean, Virginia.
  Reader's Digest bought the company in 1980, and it was renamed Source Telecomputing Corporation.
