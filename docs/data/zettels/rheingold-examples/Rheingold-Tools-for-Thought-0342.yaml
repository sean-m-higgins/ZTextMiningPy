note: |
  The person inside a full-scale media room will have 360-degree visual displays of some sort -- high-resolution video or holographic images -- computer-generated and archived.
  Images can be retrieved from a library (and added to the library), or they can be constructed by the person or by the computer.
  There will be a total-sound audio system ranging into ultralow and ultrahigh frequencies.
  But the most important element is not in the sensory displays, which involve straightforward if now-expensive technology, but in the software -- in the way the room is designed to "know" what to do.
  If the media room is to be the universal medium, the room itself must be able to see and hear the person inside, and "understand" what it sees and hears well enough to carry out the person's commands.
  Ideally, it should understand the person it is dealing with well enough to actively guide the fantasy or the information search, based on its knowledge of personal preferences and past performance.
  Bioelectronic sensors built into the floors will keep track of the user's mood.
  The only thing the room is presumed not to do is read minds.
  One of the ways to describe a media room is "a computer with no interface," or "a computer that is all interface."
  When the computer interface disappears, you are not at the control panel of a machine, but walking over the Arctic ice, or flying to Harlem, or looking through a book in a musty old room.
