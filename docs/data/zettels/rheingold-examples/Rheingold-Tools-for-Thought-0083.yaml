note: |
  Goldstine -- the other man on the platform with von Neumann -- had his own version of the key events in early computer history.
  Mauchly and Eckert had a distinctly different point of view.
  There was a tale of Stibitz at Bell Labs.
  IBM's Thomas Watson, Senior, had yet another story.
  And a man in Iowa named Atanasoff eventually had the unexpected last laugh in a courtroom in 1973.
  Monumental court cases have been fought over the issue of assigning credit for the invention of the modern computer, and even the legal decisions have been somewhat murky.
  Certainly it was a field in which a few people all over the world, working independently, reached similar conclusions.
  In the case of the ENIAC team, it was a case of several determined minds working together.
  It isn't hard to envision von Neumann coming onto the scene after others have worked for years on the considerable engineering problems involved in building ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator), then dominating the voice of the group when they articulated their discoveries, not out of self-aggrandizement, but because he undoubtedly had the most elegant way of stating the conclusions that the group had arrived at, working in concert.
  Because of von Neumann's prominence in other fields, and the way his charm worked on journalists as well as generals, he was often described by the mass media as the sole inventor of key concepts like the all-important "stored program" -- a credit he never claimed himself.
