  I couldn't help inquiring.
  Considering the fact that he had just dropped a hundred dollars in less than ten seconds, he must have been doing very well indeed to be making money at the convention faster than he was losing it in the casino.
  The crooked grin on his face, a variant of the slightly demented expression that attracted my attention at the craps table, made it clear that he didn't mind talking about his business.
  We got to know each other, and eventually I learned about what he did before he was the prime mover and chief asset of a software corporation.
  There was no sign that he was an ex-MAC hacker, ex-acidhead, ex-consultant to unnamed intelligence agencies.
  He was freckled, balding, and what hair he had left was short and neatly combed.
  He was clean-shaven, and his attire wouldn't have been out of place on an accountant or a widget salesman.
  But in his heart, he was still a hacker, and an evangelistic one at that.
  By the time we got through the story to the point of talking about his current product, it was clear that he had not turned his back on the programming priesthood, but was merely interested in expanding it, to his own profit, by giving millions of people a direct taste of the same experience that hooked him back in Building 26.
  When I was first learning, I said to myself, 'Here I am in this chord, and I've got to get to that chord.'
