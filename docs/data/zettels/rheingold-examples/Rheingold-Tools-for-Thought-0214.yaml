note: |
  The computer serves not only as a workhorse, but also as an easel for exercising one's creative abilities.
  Therefore, in my opinion, the hacker has not limited myself at all.
  Rather, he has expanded his intellectual horizon because now he has the infinite tool.
  As for the charge that it disrupts one's social life, I would tend to agree with this to a point.
  But it depends on how controlled the individual is.
  At any time, he can withdraw to a more normal schedule.
  Why doesn't he?
  The reason is obvious.
  The infinite tool that knows few boundaries is accessible to a much higher degree, and thus he can devote more time to it.
  Why is this wrong?
