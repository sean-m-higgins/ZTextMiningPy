  In a few words, he proceeded to describe what is known today as a "word processor."
  What might be the effect of such a machine on the memo-writing process?
  Engelbart's 1963 speculations sound like advertising copy for word processing systems of the 1980s -- and more: This hypothetical writing machine permits you to use a new process for composing text.
  For instance, trial drafts can rapidly be composed from rearranged excerpts of old drafts, together with new words or passages which you insert by hand typing.
  Your first draft may represent a free outpouring of thoughts in any order, with the inspection of foregoing thoughts continuously stimulating new considerations and ideas to be entered.
  If the tangle of thoughts represented by the draft becomes too complex, you can compile a reordered draft quickly.
  It would be practical for you to accommodate more complexity in the trails of thought you might build in search of the path that suits your needs.
  You can integrate new ideas more easily, and thus harness your creativity more continuously, if you can quickly and flexibly change your working record.
  If it is easier to update any part of your working record to accommodate new developments in thought or circumstance, you will find it easier to incorporate more complex procedures in your way of doing things.
  The important thing to appreciate here is that a direct new innovation in one particular capability can have far-reaching effects throughout the rest of your capability hierarchy.
