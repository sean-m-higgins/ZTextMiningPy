  He was awarded the society's first gold medal for the paper that accompanied the presentation.
  In that paper, Babbage described his plans for a much more ambitious "Difference Engine."
  In 1823, the British government awarded him the first of many grants that were to continue sporadically and controversially for years to come.
  Babbage hired a master machinist, set up shop on his estate, and began to learn at first hand how far ahead of his epoch's technological capabilities his dreams were running.
  The Difference Engine commissioned by the British government was quite a bit larger and more complex than the model demonstrated before the Royal Astronomical Society.
  But the toolmaking art of the time was not yet up to the level of precision demanded by Babbage's design.
  Work continued for years, unsuccessfully.
  The triumphal demonstration at the beginning of his enterprise looked as if it had been the high point of Babbage's career, followed by stubborn and prolonged decline.
  The British government finally gave up financing the scheme.
  Babbage, never one to shy away from conflict with unbelievers over one of his cherished ideas, feuded over the Difference Engine with the government and with his contemporaries, many of whom began to make sport of mad old Charley Babbage.
