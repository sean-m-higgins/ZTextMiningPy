note: |
  The use of statistics and probability theory was one clue.
  A method for predicting the end of a message based on information about the beginning was another clue.
  The device in Parkinson's dream was another clue.
  Then it occurred to Wiener and Bigelow that the human organism had already solved the problem they were facing.
  How is any human being, or a chimpanzee for that matter, able to reach out a hand and pick up a pencil?
  How are people able to put one foot in front of the other, fall face-forward for a short distance, and end up taking a step?
  Both processes involve continuous, precise readjustments of muscles (the servomechanisms that move the gun), guided by continuous visual information (radar), controlled by a continuous process of predicting trajectories.
  The prediction and control take place in the nervous system (the control circuits of the animating automata).
  Wiener and Bigelow looked more closely at other servomechanisms, including self-steering mechanisms as simple as thermostats, and concluded that feedback is the concept that connects the way brains, automatic artillery, steam engines, autopilots, and thermostats perform their functions.
  In each of those systems, some small part of the past output is fed back to the central processor as present input, in order to steer future output.
