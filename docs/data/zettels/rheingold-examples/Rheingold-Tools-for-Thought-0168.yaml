  You would want modelling -- an exotic new use for computers that the aircraft designers were pioneering.
  All Licklider sought, at first, was a mechanical servant to take care of the clerical and calculating work that accompanied model building.
  Not long after, however, he began to wonder if computers could help formulate models as well as calculate them.
  When he attained tenure, later that same year, Licklider decided to join a consulting firm near Cambridge named Bolt, Beranek & Newman.
  They offered him an opportunity to pursue his psychoacoustic research -- and a chance to learn about digital computers.
  The quarter-million-dollar machine was the first of a continuing line of what came to be called, in the style of the midsixties, "minicomputers."
  Instead of costing millions of dollars and occupying most of a room, these new, smaller, powerful computers only cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, and took up about the same amount of space as a couple of refrigerators.
  But they still required experts to operate them.
  Licklider therefore hired a research assistant, a college dropout who was knowledgeable about computers, an exceptionally capable young fellow by the name of Ed Fredkin, who was later to become a force in artificial intelligence research -- the first of many exceptionally capable young fellows who would be drawn to Licklider's crusade to build a new kind of computer and create a new style of computing.
  Fredkin and others at BB&N had the PDP-1 set up so that Licklider could directly interact with it.
