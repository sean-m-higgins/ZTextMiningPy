note: |
  In order to disguise the appearance, voice, and other sensory clues from the players, the interrogation takes place over a teletype.
  Turing then asks us to substitute a machine for one of the unknown players and make a new object for the game: This time, the interrogator is to guess, on the basis of the teletyped conversation, which inhabitant of the other room is a human being and which one is a machine.
  In describing how such a conversation might go, Turing quoted a brief "specimen" of such a dialog: Q: Please write me a sonnet on the subject of the Forth Bridge.
  A: Count me out on this one.
  I could never write poetry.
  Q: Add 44957 to 70764.
  A: (pause about 30 seconds and then give as answer) 105621.
  Q: Do you play chess?
  A: Yes.
  Q: I have K at my K1, and no other pieces.
