  It was around 1956 that McCarthy started using the words "artificial intelligence."
  The Dartmouth Conference was the constitutional convention of the artificial intelligence faction, and it was also the place where two virtually unknown Rand programmers named Alan Newell and Herbert Simon breezed in from Santa Monica with a piece of software they wrote with Cliff Shaw.
  To everyone's astonishment, it was a program -- the famous Logic Theorist that could prove theorems from Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica -- that actually did what the rest of them thought they were there to plan to do.
  Hopes were high for the AI rebels in 1956 and 1957.
  Major efforts were under way and ambitious goals were in sight.
  A very few unorthodox thinkers staked their careers on the conviction that this branch of computer science, formerly a branch of science fiction, would soon be seen as more important than anything else humankind had ever attempted: Minsky remained at MIT and concentrated on the problem of how knowledge is represented in minds and machines; Newell and Simon (now a Nobel Laureate) began their long association with one another and Carnegie-Mellon University, where they concentrated on the information processing approach to psychology and AI design; McCarthy created LISP, a language specifically for conducting AI research, and left MIT to preside over Stanford's AI laboratory.
  Claude Shannon went back to his chess playing machines and continued building the mechanical mice that could learn how to run simple mazes.
  In 1956, Robert Fano, the electrical engineering student who witnessed Norbert Wiener's "Entropy is information!"
  His professional standing was so far beyond reproach that his occasional unicycle excursions through MIT halls, and his reluctance to lecture or publish frequently, hardly dented Shannon's reputation.
  In fact, his reputation had reached such mythological proportions that he had to start writing disclaimers.
