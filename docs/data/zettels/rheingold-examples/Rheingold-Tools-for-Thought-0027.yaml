  Byron wrote poignant passages about Ada in some of his poetry, and she asked to be buried next to him--probably to spite her mother, who outlived her.
  Ada's mother, portrayed by biographers as a vain and overbearing Victorian figure, thought a daily dose of a laudanum-laced "tonic" would be the perfect cure for her beautiful, outspoken daughter's nonconforming behavior, and thus forced an addiction on her!
  Ada exhibited her mathematical talents early in life.
  One of her family's closest friends was Augustus De Morgan, the famous British Logician.
  She was well tutored, but always seemed to thirst for more knowledge than her tutors could provide.
  Ada actively sought the perfect mentor, whom she thought she found in a contemporary of her mother's--Charles Babbage.
  Mrs. De Morgan was present at the historic occasion when the young Ada Byron was first shown a working model of the Difference Engine, during a demonstration Babbage held for Lady Byron's friends.
  In her memoirs, Mrs. De Morgan remembered the effect the contraption had on Augusta Ada: "While the rest of the party gazed at this beautiful invention with the same sort of expression and feeling that some savages are said to have shown on first seeing a looking glass or hearing a gun, Miss Byron, young as she was, understood its working and saw the great beauty of the invention."
  Such parlor demonstrations of mechanical devices were in vogue among the British upper classes during the Industrial Revolution.
  While her elders tittered and gossiped and failed to understand the difference between this calculator and the various water pumps they had observed at other demonstrations, young Ada began to knowledgeably poke and probe various parts of the mechanism, thus becoming the first computer whiz kid.
