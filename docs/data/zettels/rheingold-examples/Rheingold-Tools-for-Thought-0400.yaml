note: |
  Scientific literature, the very basis of worldwide scientific scholarship, consists of published documents which refer to many previously published documents.
  An experiment is usually performed to test a hypothesis that was based on previous experiments.
  Performing a "search of the literature" is the first thing a scientist does when confronted with a new research problem.
  The problem today is that scientific research is too successful.
  As Vannevar Bush warned forty years ago, the rate and volume of scientific publication have overwhelmed the coping capacity of our print-era technology.
  With a hypertext system, each scientific document could have links to its intellectual antecedents and to documents regarding related problems.
  The entire body of relevant scientific literature could be collapsed into each individual document.
  The links would function in the same way as footnotes, but with immediate access to the cited material, as if each footnote was like a window or door into the cited document.
  A system with links, backtrack, and versioning needs only an economic structure to become a publishing system.
  Nelson sees an anarchic but self-organizing system based on his conception of royalties and subroyalties.
