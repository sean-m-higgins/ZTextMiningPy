note: |
  A coven is an affinity group of witches.
  The name is very old.
  Some covens have fierce strict codes of behavior and rules of ceremony and others get together now and then and shoot the shit.
  By and large, witches have the best parties of any groups going.
  There is another organization in the California area known as the New Reformed Orthodox Order of the Golden Dawn, which was started as a gag in the 60s and presently has several thousand members, a good many of which can apparently be counted on to show up for a bash.
  It is typically pagan, incidentally, to start your biggest umbrella organization for a joke.
  Lots of witches compute, and there are probably a bunch on this very tree who have not bothered to identify themselves.
  Religion, ancient or modern, is still less popular than sex as a topic for BBS discussion.
  A certain steady percentage of boards are entirely sexually oriented.
  The problem used to be that there simple weren't any females on the system, but that appears to be changing rapidly.
