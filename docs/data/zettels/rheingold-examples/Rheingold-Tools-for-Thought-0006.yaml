  If the predictions of some of the people in this book continue to be accurate, our whole environment will suddenly take on a kind of intelligence of its own sometime between now and the turn of the century.
  Fifteen years from now, there will be a microchip in your telephone receiver with more computing power than all the technology the Defense Department can buy today.
  All the written knowledge in the world will be one of the items to be found in every schoolchild's pocket.
  The computer of the twenty-first century will be everywhere, for better or for worse, and a more appropriate prophet than Orwell for this eventuality might well be Marshall McLuhan.
  If McLuhan was right about the medium being the message, what will it mean when the entire environment becomes the medium?
  If such development does occur as predicted, it will probably turn out differently from even the wildest "computerized household" scenarios of the recent past.
  The possibility of accurately predicting the social impact of any new technology is questionable, to say the least.
  At the beginning of the twentieth century, it was impossible for average people or even the most knowledgeable scientists to envision what life would be like for their grandchildren, who we now know would sit down in front of little boxes and watch events happening at that moment on the other side of the world.
  Today, only a few people are thinking seriously about what to do with a living room wall that can tell you anything you want to know, simulate anything you want to see, connect you with any person or group of people you want to communicate with, and even help you find out what it is when you aren't entirely sure.
  In the 1990s it might be possible for people to "think as no human being has ever thought" and for computers to "process data in a way not approached by the information-handling machines we know today," as J.C.R.
