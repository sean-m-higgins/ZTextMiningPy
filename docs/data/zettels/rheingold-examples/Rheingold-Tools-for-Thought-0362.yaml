  The methodology for conducting such an evaluation was suggested in the 1950s, by Alan Turing.
  The "Turing test" bypasses abstract arguments about artificial intelligence by asking people to determine whether or not the system they are communicating with via teletype is a machine or a person.
  If most people can't distinguish a computer from another human, strictly by the way the other party responds to questions, then the other party is deemed to be intelligent.
  A similar strategy has been employed to judge the efficacy of expert systems.
  Why not just ask some human experts to distinguish human from machine diagnoses?
  One experiment conducted by the Stanford Medical School began by submitting to MYCIN case histories of ten patients with different types of infectious meningitis.
  At the same time, eight human physicians, including five faculty specialists in infectious diseases, a research fellow, and a resident, were given the same information that had been fed to MYCIN.
  MYCIN's recommendations were sent, along with the human physicians' recommendations, also unidentified as such, and a record of the therapy the patients actually received, to eight non-Stanford specialists.
  The outside specialists gave the highest rating to MYCIN.
  In the 1980s, there is little question that expert systems can be highly effective, if not superior to human expertise, in certain highly specialized fields.
