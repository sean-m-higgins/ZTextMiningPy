  In seeking a domain where a small success would mean a large boost in effectiveness, and where success would attract a large-scale research and development effort, Doug chose to augment the "humdrum but practical and important sorts of tasks" that occupy an increasing proportion of the people in our society: preparing, editing, and publishing documents.
  This area of document preparation and communication was but a small slice from the grand range of applications he envisioned, but it was one tool that the augmentation team itself needed immediately, and one that every laboratory and office in the world would want -- as soon as people understood that computers weren't just calculators.
  The seventeen members of the Augmentation Research Center, Engelbart explained during their 1968 show, were attempting to create a medium that would be useful to the other ARPA computer researchers and eventually to anyone who works with information.
  At the same time, this was a behavioral science experiment as well as a computer systems experiment, because the project team would be the subjects as well as the architects of the research.
  Making computers do what they wanted was only the beginning.
  The really difficult work was adjusting themselves to new ways of working and thinking.
  Consequently, one of the first projects was to create a system to make it easy for the members of the research team -- and eventually for other intellectual workers -- to compose, store and retrieve, edit, and communicate words, numbers, and graphics.
  They needed to invent display devices and adapt the computer and write the programs; then they had to use what they had invented to compose a description of the system.
  The hardware and software specialists worked on representing symbols on screens and storing them in the computer's memory.
  Then the communications specialists used the text editors to write the manuals to instruct future members of the growing project in the use of new tools.
