  There is a great value in merely conducting themselves as though they were congregated at a magic blackboard -- each easily able to pull forth materials from his notes or familiar reference sources, copy across into his private workplace any material offered from what the other brings forth.
  In 1969, ARC became one of the original nodes of the ARPAnet system that connected defense-related research computers around the country into a network.
  The network, Bob Taylor's brainchild, used common-carrier communication lines to interconnect computers in different parts of the country.
  While the separate time-sharing communities were busy exchanging data, programs, and messages, the ARC people saw their participation in the network as an opportunity to put their knowledge to good use, and to extend their experiment beyond their SRI laboratory to include everyone around the country who was connected to the network.
  As the network grew, ARC branched out from its primary activity of continually redesigning itself.
  It began serving as the Network Information Center, offering referencing and organizing services for the distributed community of ARPAnet users.
  No longer languishing in a half-forgotten Quonset somewhere on the huge SRI grounds, the augmentation laboratory, equipped with the latest time-sharing hardware, was by 1970 the proud subject of VIP tours.
  After so many years of solitary envisioning, Engelbart had become even more optimistic about the ultimate significance of their enterprise than he had been when he started.
  In the spring of 1970 he told his colleagues at the Interdisciplinary conference on multi-access Computer Networks: .
  It has been my business to struggle with these concepts for two decades now, and the signs that I read at least tell me that the changes in our ways of thinking and working will be more pervasive and extreme than ANY OF US appreciates -- a revolution like the development of writing and the printing press lumped together.
