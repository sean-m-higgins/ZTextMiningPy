  The Cervantes of Hypertext might be learning to read right about now.
  Twenty years ago, the few hundred people who built time-sharing began to get excited about several new means of communication that were becoming possible via computer mediation.
  Fifteen years ago, the thousand-odd people who joined the first version of ARPAnet began to experiment with the new media -- in their daily work as a way to have fun.
  About a decade ago, another group of people began to concentrate on software systems specifically designed to facilitate communications among a dispersed community -- computer teleconferencing.
  The concept of computerized conferencing came from the usual convergence of unexpected factors -- in this case the Berlin airlift of 1948, a decision tool invented by a think tank, and the wage-price freeze of 1971.
  The idea was to build a system in which computers make it possible for groups that are separated by both space and time to communicate in various ways, over common-carrier communication lines.
  Community communication was first tired during the Berlin airlift, when the only agency with direct real-time communications of its own to all the NATO countries was the State Department, with its old-style teletype machines.
  Somebody tried to wire all these machines together, without the aid of computers to help organize the message-stream -- which created a classic mess, and the classic story of the birth of the new medium.
  The earliest development of the idea of using computer mediation in geographically dispersed conferences is most widely associated with Murray Turoff, the standard eccentric prodigy, the character who happens to see everything differently and who, like other young, independent-minded thinkers before him, liked to follow an idea wherever it led him.
  In the late 1960s, Turoff was working on war games and other kinds of computer-based simulations for a Washington, D.C., think tank, the Institute for Defense Analysis.
