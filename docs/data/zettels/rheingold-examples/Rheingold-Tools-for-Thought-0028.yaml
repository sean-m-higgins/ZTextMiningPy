  Ada was one of the few to recognize that the Difference Engine was altogether a different sort of device than the mechanical calculators of the past.
  Whereas previous devices were analog (performing calculation by means of measurement), Babbage's was digital (performing calculation by means of counting).
  More importantly, Babbage's design combined arithmetic and logical functions.
  Ada, who had been tutored by De Morgan, the foremost logician of his time, had ideas of her own about the possibilities of what one might do with such devices.
  Of Ada's gift for this new type of partially mathematical, partially logical exercise, Babbage himself noted: "She seems to understand it better than I do, and is far, far better at explaining it."
  At the age of nineteen, Ada married Lord King, Baron of Lovelace.
  Her husband was also something of a mathematician, although his talents were far inferior to those of his wife.
  The young countess Lovelace continued her mathematical and computational partnership with Babbage, resolutely supporting what she knew to be a solid idea, at a time when less-foresighted members of the British establishment dismissed Babbage as a crank.
  Babbage toured the Continent in 1840, lecturing on the subject of the device he never succeeded in building.
  In Italy, a certain Count Menabrea in Italy took extensive notes at one of the lectures and published them in Paris.
