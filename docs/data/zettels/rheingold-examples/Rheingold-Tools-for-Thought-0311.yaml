  When he came across the LOGO work, during the time he was meditating about the fact that he had put two years into the FLEX machine only to find that it wasn't amenable to humans who tried to use it, Alan Kay recalls that "it was like a light going on in my head.
  I knew I would never design another program that was not set up for children."
  One of the first things he understood was that a program or a programming language that can be learned by children doesn't have to be a "toy."
  The toy can also serve as a tool.
  But that transformation doesn't happen naturally -- it comes about through a great deal of work by the person who designs the language.
  Kay already knew that the most important tools for creating personal computing were to be found in the software, but now it dawned on him that the power those tools would amplify would be the power to learn -- whether the user is a child, a computer systems designer, or an artificial intelligence program.
  Although he knew he had a monstrous software task ahead of him if he was to create a means by which even children could use computers as a simulation tool, his FLEX experience and his exposure to LOGO convinced Kay that there was far more to it than just building an easy-to-operate computer and creating a new kind of computer language.
  It was something akin to the problem of building a tool that a child could use to build a sandcastle, but would be equally useful to architects who wanted to erect skyscrapers.
  What he had in mind was an altogether new kind of artifact: If he ended up with something an eight-year-old could carry in one hand and use to communicate music, words, pictures, and to consult museums and libraries, would the device be perceived as a tool or as a toy?
  Kay began to understand that what he wanted to create was an entirely new medium -- a medium that would be fundamentally different from all the previous static media of history.
