  Fame wasn't something he wanted or needed.
  By 1960, he didn't even come to the office.
  In the 1960s Shannon became interested in the stock market as a real-world experiment in probability theory, and rumor has it that he didn't do too badly.
  He began to seriously extend his analysis of communications and messages to the English language.
  Nobody but Shannon knows the full extent of his discoveries.
  Robert Fano (who went on to become the administrative director of Project MAC) recently said this of Shannon: There is a significant body of work he did in the 1950s that has never been printed.
  He doesn't want someone else to write his papers for him, and he won't write them himself.
  It's as simple and as complicated as that.
  He doesn't like to teach.
  He doesn't like giving lectures.
