note: |
  I think it is definitely a bonus, since the usual restraints of 9-to-5 are eliminated and the person is allowed to expand beyond boundaries to do what he wants.
  Now we come to the human versus the machine factor.
  Gandalf stresses the necessity of human interaction and the inherent evil of the machine.
  Would you stress the evil of instruments in an orchestra, or the instruments in a laboratory, or the typewriter of an author?
  All of these occupations demand extraordinary amounts of time for excellence.
  But I see no greater human interaction in these fields than in computers.
  I feel that people who disparage computers for a seemingly decreased human interaction are not at all familiar with the true import of the computer.
  Not only is it the infinite tool, it is also an extremely fluid medium of communication.
  The publication of the controversy set off an avalanche of electronic mail over the ARPAnet and at local computer centers.
  The hacker debates had spread to the amateur "bulletin board computers" by 1983, when the movie WarGames and the real-life young computer-systems "crackers" who subsequently surfaced brought the word hacker to widespread public attention, in this newer, unpleasantly restricted sense.
