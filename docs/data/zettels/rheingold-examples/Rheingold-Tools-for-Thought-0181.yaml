  The human story was concentrated on the men in the capsules atop the rockets.
  But the unsung heroics that ensured the success of the space program were conducted by men using new kinds of computers.
  Remember the crew at mission control, who burst into cheers at a successful launch, and who looked so cool nineteen hours later when the astronaut and the mission depended on their solutions to unexpected glitches?
  When the bright young men at their computer monitors were televised during the first launches from Cape Canaveral, the picture America saw of their working habitat reflected the results of the research Licklider and the presentation group had performed.
  After all, the kinds of computer displays you need for NORAD (North American Air Defense Command) aren't too different from the kind you need for NASA -- in both cases, groups of people are using computers to track the path of multiple objects in space.
  NASA and ARPA shared results in the computer field -- a kind of bureaucratic cooperation that was relatively rare in the pre-Sputnik era.
  Because the Russians appeared to be far ahead of us in the development of huge booster rockets, it was decided that the United States should concentrate on guidance systems and ultralight (i.e., ultraminiature) components for our less powerful rockets -- a policy that was rooted in the fundamental thinking established by the ICBM committee a few years back, in the von Neumann days.
  Therefore the space program and the missile program both required the rapid development of very small, extremely reliable computers.
  The decision of the richest, most powerful nation in history to put a major part of its resources into the development of electronic-based technologies happened at an exceptionally propitious moment in the history of electronics.
  The basic scientific discoveries that made the miniaturization revolution possible -- the new field of semiconductor research that produced the transistor and then the integrated circuit -- made it clear that 1960 was just the beginning of the rapid evolution of computers.
