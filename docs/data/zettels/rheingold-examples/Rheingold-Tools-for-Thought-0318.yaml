  Kay felt that the threshold number of picture elements needed to most strongly attract and hold the attention of a large population of computer users, and give the users significant power to control the computer, would be around one million dots.
  The Alto computer being constructed for PARC researchers -- which the Learning Research Group called "an interim Dynabook" -- would have around half a million dots.
  The technique by which the Alto would achieve its high-resolution screen was called "bit-mapping," a term that meant that each picture element, each dot of light on the display screen, was connected to one bit of information in a specific place in the computer's memory, thus creating a kind of two-way informational map of the screen.
  If, for example, a specific bit in the computer's "memory map" was turned off, there would not be a dot of light at the location on the screen.
  Conversely, an "on" bit at a coordinate in the memory map would produce a dot of light at the designated screen location.
  By turning on and off parts of the bit map through software commands, recognizable graphic images can be created (and changed) on the screen.
  Bit-mapping was a major step toward creating a computer that an individual could use comfortably, whether the user is an expert programmer or a beginner.
  The importance of a visual display that is connected directly to the computer's memory is related to the human talent for recognizing very subtle visual patterns in large fields of information -- undoubtedly a survival trait that evolved way back when our ancestors climbed trees and prowled savannas.
  Human information processors have a very small short term memory, however, which means that all computers and no humans can extract the square roots of thousand-digit numbers in less than a second, no computers and all humans can recognize a familiar face in a crowd.
  By connecting part of the computer's internal processes to a visible symbolic representation, bit-mapping puts the most sophisticated part of the human information processor in closer contact with the most sophisticated part of the mechanical information processor.
