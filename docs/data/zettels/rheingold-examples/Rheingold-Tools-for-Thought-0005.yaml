note: |
  When information processing grows into knowledge processing, the true personal computer will reach beyond hardware and connect with a vaster source of power than that of electronic microcircuitry--the power of human minds working in concert.
  The nature of the world we create in the closing years of the twentieth century will be determined to a significant degree by our attitudes toward this new category of tool.
  Many of us who were educated in the pre-computer era shall be learning new skills.
  The college class of 1999 is already on its way.
  It is important that we realize today that those skills of tomorrow will have little to do with how to operate computers and a great deal to do with how to use augmented intellects, enhanced communications, and amplified imaginations.
  Forget about "computer literacy" or obfuscating technical jargon, for these aberrations will disappear when the machines and their programs grow more intelligent.
  The reason for building a personal computer in the first place was to enable people to do what people do best by using machines to do what machines do best.
  Many people are afraid of today's computers because they have been told that these machines are smarter than they are--a deception that is reinforced by the rituals that novices have been forced to undergo in order to use computers.
  In fact, the burden of communication should be on the machine.
  A computer that is difficult to use is a computer that's too dumb to understand what you want.
