  How does one envision the capabilities of a technology that doesn't exist yet?
  How do you deal with an invisible computer?
  If you don't have to worry about how to tell it what to do, and if its computer-representation capabilities are too large to worry about, the question shifts from the tool to the task: "Okay, now that I can go anywhere, including places that don't exist, where do I want to go?"
  Brenda, Eric, and their colleagues wanted to know what new communication styles people might adopt in response to such a system.
  Most of all, they wanted to know how it would feel to use such a system.
  The night I watched her and her colleagues fantasize in that room in Sunnyvale, Brenda's idea was to plan the uses of a future technology of this sort by using the same kinds of tricks that actors use to create imaginary spaces: "Magical kinds of things can happen through improvisation," she told the group, "because it can trick you into revealing preverbal ideas.
  What we each bring to this is our capacity to have inspirations in real time."
  The first improvisations were warm-up exercises.
  Brenda's trip to the Library of Alexandria was followed by Scott's visit to a hypermirror that showed him what he looked like in the infrared and gave him a real-time scan of his brain metabolism in sixteen colors.
  He watched the colors of his thought processes as he watched the colors of his thought processes.
