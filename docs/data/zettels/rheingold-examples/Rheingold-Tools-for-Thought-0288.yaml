  Distributed systems, in which a number of people, each with their own significantly powerful personal computers, join together into even more powerful computational communities, are altogether different from the centrally controlled and highly restricted computers of the early days.
  Where we will all choose to go, or be forced to go by human nature or historical circumstances, once we are given access to such a system, is a wide-open question, once you get beyond the revolutionary but relatively simple applications to office work.
  Almost all the augmentation pioneers now use the analogy of the early days of automobiles to describe the present state of the system.
  Engelbart and Taylor agree that the personal computers millions of enthusiasts are using today are not even at the stage the automobile industry reached with the model T. More important, there is not yet a widespread transportation support structure for the messages between individuals.
  There are no standard ways to build or drive the informational vehicles that have been devised only recently.
  The existing highways for large-scale, high-bandwidth information transportation don't even cover a fraction of the countryside.
  There are no service stations or road maps.
  The tire industry and the petroleum industry of the knowledge age don't exist yet.
  There may be prototypes of mind-extending technologies at places like PARC, but there is not yet an infrastructure to support their use in wider society.
  The researchers at PARC were wildly successful in their efforts to build powerful personal computers, years before the business and consumer communities were prepared to accept them, but Xerox marketing management failed to take advantage of the head start achieved by their research and development teams by quickly turning the prototypes into products.
