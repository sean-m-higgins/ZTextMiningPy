  Nobody wore a plastic penholder.
  As it was explained to me by Brenda and by Eric, whose project it was, a media room is an information terminal that a person can walk around inside -- a place where you can communicate directly with the machine without explicit input devices like keyboards.
  The room itself is set up to monitor human communication output.
  This presumes that all the hardware and software that are now in experimental or developmental stages will be working together to do what a good media room does -- without bothering the person who uses it with details of its operations.
  Eric came to Atari from MIT's Architecture Machine Group, an innovative group led by Alan Kay's old friend and Atari consultant Nick Negroponte.
  The idea of "spatial data management" that came from the MIT group was a response to the problem of finding a way to navigate the huge new informational realms opened by computers, by adopting the metaphor of information space that the user can more or less "fly" through.
  The dominant metaphor in software design viewed large collections of information through the well-known "file-cabinet" metaphor, in which each piece of information is regarded as part of a "file folder" that the user locates through traditional filing methods.
  But what if the collection of information could be displayed visually and arranged spatially, so the user could have the illusion of "navigating" through it?
  Perhaps the most well-known demonstration of this metaphor was the "Aspen Map" created by Negroponte's group.
  To use this map, you sit in front of a video screen and touch the screen to steer your way down a photographic representation of the streets and houses of Aspen, Colorado.
