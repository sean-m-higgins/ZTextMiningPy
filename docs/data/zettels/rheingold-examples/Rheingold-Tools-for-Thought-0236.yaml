  How do we adapt to new ways of thinking?
  Engelbart used the metaphor of a toolkit, and proposed that we organize our intellectual problem-solving tools in a hierarchy: It is likely that each individual develops a certain repertory of process capabilities from which he selects and adapts those that will compose the processes that he executes.
  This repertory is like a toolkit.
  Just as the mechanic must know what his tools can do and how to use them, so the intellectual worker must know the capabilities of his tools and have suitable methods, strategies, and rules of thumb for making use of them.
  All of the process capabilities in the individual's repertory rest ultimately on basic capabilities within him or his artifacts, and the entire repertory represents an integrated, hierarchical structure (which we often call the repertory hierarchy).
  As an example, Engelbart offered the process of issuing a memorandum -- a task that involves putting specific information in a formal package and distributing it to other people.
  The reason for writing the memo, the memowriter's role in the organization, the intended audience, the importance of the subject matter of the memo to the organization's goals -- these are the higher level components of the hierarchy.
  At an intermediate level are the skills of marshaling facts, soliciting opinions, thinking, formulating ideas, weighing alternatives, forecasting, making judgments, that go into framing the memo, and all the communication skills that go into putting the memo into form.
  Toward the bottom of the hierarchy are the artifacts used to prepare the memo and the medium by which it is communicated -- typewriter, pencil, paper, interoffice mail.
  Engelbart proposed a hypothetical method for boosting the effectiveness of the whole system by introducing an innovative technology into a relatively low level of the hierarchy.
