  The engineering people said, "There's no way that kind of idea is going to fly."
  The interactive stuff was so wild that the people who knew about computers didn't want to hear about it.
  Back then, you didn't interact with a computer, even if you were a programmer.
  You gave it your question, in the form of a box of punched cards, and if you had worked very hard at stating the question correctly, you got your answer.
  Computers weren't meant for direct interaction.
  And this idea of using them to help people learn was downright blasphemy.
  After he got his doctorate, Engelbart came to another one of those internally triggered decision points in his life that his dream continued to bring his way.
  Nobody in his department wanted to listen to talk about building a better way to solve complex problems, and he felt that he would have to construct a whole new academic discipline before he could begin the research he really wanted to do.
  The university, Engelbart decided, was a place to get his journeyman's card, but not a place to follow his vision.
  Thus, young Doctor Engelbart went to the commercial world, looking for an opportunity to develop electronic systems that would eventually help him do what he wanted in terms of augmenting human intellect, and would pay his room and board as he contributed to the development of marketable devices as well.
