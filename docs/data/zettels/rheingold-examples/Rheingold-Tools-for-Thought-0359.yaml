  For example, consider the following scenario: A general practitioner in a small town in the Southwest was awakened late one night by an emergency call -- a six-year-old girl had been admitted to the local hospital.
  She was comatose, and she had a high fever.
  The doctor ordered all clinical tests that were available at that hour in a one-hospital town and called the pathologist.
  The symptoms, and the results of the first tests, weren't anything the GP or the pathologist had seen before.
  Drugs were available -- the pharmacy was well equipped, even if specialized expertise was in short supply.
  But which drug?
  Choosing the proper antibiotic from the hundreds of possibilities was a matter of life and death for the little girl, and neither the GP nor the pathologist was comfortable about staking the young patient's life on guesswork.
  They took their laboratory results over to the local community college, where one of the young programmers who always seemed to be around in the middle of the night used a microcomputer and a telephone to put them in contact with an expert in Palo Alto, California, who knew just the right questions to ask about a case like this.
  With the help of clues provided over the telephone by the expert, the local doctors were able to administer one more test that narrowed their search for the disease-causing organism down to one of the three possibilities suggested by the specialist.
  There were drugs on hand for treating the infection that the long-distance expert had helped them pinpoint.
