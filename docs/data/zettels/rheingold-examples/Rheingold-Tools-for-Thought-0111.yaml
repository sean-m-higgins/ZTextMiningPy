  Against von Neumann's mild objections, the Rand machine was dubbed JOHNNIAC.
  The Los Alamos machine assigned to nuclear weapons-related calculations was given the strangely uneuphemistic name of MANIAC.
  British computer builders, who had been pursuing parallel research and who were aware of Von Neumann's ideas, beat the Americans when it came to constructing a machine based on the logical principles enunciated by von Neumann.
  The first machine that was binary, serial, and used stored-program memory was EDSAC -- the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator, built at the University Mathematical Laboratory, University of Cambridge, England.)
  In a von Neumann machine, the arithmetic and logic unit is where the basic operations of the system are wired in.
  All the other instructions are constructed out of these fundamentals.
  It is possible, in principle, to build a device of this type with very few, extremely simple, built-in operations.
  Addition, for example, could be performed over and over again whenever a multiplication operation is requested by a program.
  In fact, the only two operations that are absolutely necessary are "not" and "and."
  The problem with using a few very simple hardwired operations and proportionally complex software structures built from them is that it slows down the operation of the computer: Because instructions are executed one at a time ("serially") as the internal clock ticks, the number of basic instructions in a program dictates how long it takes a computer to run that program.
