note: |
  Such a software advance as the kind Kay envisioned could only be accomplished by using hardware that didn't exist yet in 1969, since the computing power required for each individual unit would have to be several hundred times that of the most sophisticated time-sharing computers of the 1960s.
  But at the end of the 1960s, such previously undreamed-of computing power seemed to be possible, if not imminent.
  The year 1969 was pivotal in the evolution of personal computing, as well as in Alan Kay's career.
  It was the year that the ARPAnet time-sharing communities began to discover that they were all plugged into a new kind of social-informational entity, and enthusiastically began to use their new medium to design the next generations of hardware and software.
  After he finished his thesis on FLEX, Kay began to pursue his goal of designing a new computer language in one of the few places that had had the hardware, the software, and the critical mass of brain power to support his future plans -- the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.
  He had a lot to think about.
  There were many great programmers, but very few great creators of programming languages.
  The programming language for the eventual successor to FLEX was his primary interest, not only because he knew that the hardware would be catching up to him, but because he knew that programming languages influence the minds of the people who use computers.
  In 1977, after the task of creating his new programming language, Smalltalk, was accomplished, Kay described the importance of this connection between a programming language and the thinking of the person who uses it: The particular structure of a symbolic language is important because it provides a context in which some concepts are easier to think about than others.
  For example, mathematical notation first arose to abbreviate concepts that could be expressed only as ungainly circumlocutions in natural language.
