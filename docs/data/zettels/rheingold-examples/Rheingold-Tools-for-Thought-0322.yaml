  It may be representational or abstract.
  The essence of a medium is very much dependent on the way messages are embedded, changed, and viewed.
  Although digital computers were originally designed to do arithmetic computation, the ability to simulate the details of any descriptive model means that the computer, viewed as a medium in itself, can be all other media if the embedding and viewing methods are sufficiently well provided.
  Moreover, this new "metamedium" is active -- it can respond to queries and experiments -- so that the messages may involve the learner in a two-way conversation.
  This property has never been available before except through the medium of an individual teacher.
  We think the implications are vast and compelling.
  A dynamic medium for creative thought: the Dynabook.
  Imagine having your own self-contained knowledge navigator in a portable package the size and shape of an ordinary notebook.
  Suppose it had enough power to outrace your senses of sight and hearing, enough capacity to store for later retrieval thousands of page-equivalents of reference materials, poems, letters, recipes, records, drawings, animations, musical scores, waveforms, dynamic simulations, and anything else you would like to remember and change.
  The Learning Research Group introduced students from the nearby Jordan Middle School in Palo Alto to what they called "interim Dynabooks."
