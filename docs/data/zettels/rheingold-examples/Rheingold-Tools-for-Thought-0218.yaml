  Thus he was one of many formerly sequestered programmers who joined the software business at the beginning of the consumer computing boom, when it was still possible for a programmer-turned-entrepreneur to go far and fast.
  A couple of other, older, MIT hackers put out VisiCalc in 1978 -- the "electronic spreadsheet" that allows users to ask "what-if" questions about numerical data -- and millions of people who had never touched a keyboard before began tackling problems that had formerly been reserved for mainframe programmers.
  I first met David Rodman in the early 1980s, because of his strange grin.
  I knew his name because it was stamped onto the plastic card that was pinned to his lapel.
  His rumpled suit and convention badge didn't exactly mark him as a high roller, but his smile projected a self-assurance of almost demented intensity.
  We were standing in the magnificent casino that is conveniently located between the Hilton lobby and the indoor walkway to the Las Vegas convention center.
  Upward of fifty thousand people attending Comdex, a national convention for the microcomputer industry, trooped through the casino every day.
  The arriving computerists didn't mind spending their money, and they were an amiable group.
  A lot of them seemed downright happy.
  David Rodman, for example, was still smiling after he turned away from the craps table.
