  If machinery might someday help in creating its own programming, would machinery ever be capable, even in principle, of performing activities that resembled human thought?
  His 1936 paper was published in a mathematical journal, but it eventually created the foundation of a whole new field of investigation beyond the horizons of mathematics -- computer science.
  In 1950, Turing published another article that was to have profound impact; the piece, more simply titled "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," was published in the philosophical journal Mind.
  In relatively few words, using tools no more esoteric than common sense, and absolutely no mathematical formulas, Turing provided the boldest subspecialty of computer science -- the field of artificial intelligence.
  Despite the simplicity of Turing's hypothetical machine, the formal description in the mathematics journal makes very heavy reading.
  The 1950 article, however, is worth reading by anyone interested in the issue of artificial intelligence.
  The very first sentence still sounds as direct and provocative as Turing undoubtedly intended it to be: "I propose to consider the question 'Can machines think?'
  He called this one "The Imitation Game," but history knows it as the "Turing Test."
  Let us begin, he wrote, by putting aside the question of machine intelligence and consider a game played by three people -- a man, a woman, and an interrogator of either gender, who is located in a room apart from the other two.
  The object of the game is to ask questions of the people in the other room, and to eventually identify which one is the man and which is the woman -- on the basis of the answers alone.
