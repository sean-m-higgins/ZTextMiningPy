  Thus, technological inventions change as they are applied to people's needs, and the activities that people undertake change with the availability of new technologies.
  And as people in industry try to push the new technology toward some profitable niche, they will also explore the nature of the underlying phenomena.
  Of course, it is not just the scientists and engineers who developed the new technology who are involved in this exploration: Half the job involves finding out what the new capabilities can do for people.
  In order to build an expert system, a knowledge engineer needs to encode the rules a human expert uses to make decisions about problems in a specific field, then connect those decision rules with a large collection of facts about that field.
  The human expert is asked to test the software model.
  If the human expert disagrees with the system's suggested solution to a problem, then the human asks the system to reconstruct the chain of rules and facts that led to its decision.
  By pinpointing the places where the program went wrong, the human expert and the knowledge engineer turn their rough mock-up into a working expert system by a process of progressive debugging.
  Eventually, they end up with a program that will agree with the human expert a very high proportion of the time.
  Consensus comes in when you ask a second expert to evaluate the system.
  In real life, human experts disagree with one another, even at the highest levels of expertise.
