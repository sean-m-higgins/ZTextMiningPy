  He was even an outsider to those outsiders who were dropping out of MIT and hanging around Building 26.
  A Swarthmore/Harvard person just wasn't versed in the way Bronx-Science/MIT people talked about computers.
  He couldn't find any jobs as a computer dreamer, but he did manage to find a position as a photographer and film editor at a laboratory in Miami where a man named John Lilly was conducting research on dolphin intelligence.
  Lilly had a very rare piece of instrumentation -- one of the original LINC microcomputers designed by Wes Clark.
  After that came a job teaching sociology at Vassar.
  Over the next two years, while he taught sociology and thought about the complexities of storing and cross-referencing that had prevented him from finishing his note-keeping program, Nelson realized that he was trying to create a new kind of thing.
  It was a tool, but it was also a library, and a medium, and a legion of slave-librarians.
  In the mid-1960s, when he was working at a book firm, he started to call the whole scheme Xanadu.
  He says it is "a traditional name for a magic place of literary memory," but it is worth noting that Coleridge's poem of that name, like Nelson's term project, was unfinished.
  By the late sixties, having offended anyone who could help him in the worlds of academic, commercial, and military computing, Ted was free to find a few like-minded and computer-obsessed friends and attempt to write the software that would make Xanadu possible.
