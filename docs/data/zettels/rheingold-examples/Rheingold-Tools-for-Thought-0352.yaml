  Substitute drama for disease, and the elements of drama (like universality and causality) for symptoms, and the automatic drama expert in our fantasy will be able to pick out the most dramatic responses and consequences for actions that the player performs, and weave them back into the fantasy.
  It's an idea that seems to be as far ahead of today's entertainment software as Alan Kay's Dynabook was ahead of the computer hardware of the 1960s.
  Assume that you can simulate a medieval castle and give an audience member a 360 degree, first-person role in the dramatic action, so that every time you step into the Hamlet world as Horatio or Hamlet or Ophelia, you make different choices about the outcome.
  Artificial intelligence research tells us that you don't have to specifically store all the possible events that could occur in a giant data base if you can structure the representation of the world in such a way that its characteristics are formulated as tendencies to go in certain directions.
  When you pick up a stone, for example, you are likely to find crawly things under it.
  Leaving aside the technical arguments about the feasibility of constructing such a system, Brenda is most concerned about what effects the experience of encountering such a system like the one she described might have upon our emotions as well as our cognitions: How does it feel to experience a world like that?
  How does it change my perception to walk through its portals?
  How do I find out where the edges are?
  What kind of transactions can I have with this world?"
  The experience Brenda described is the experience at the human interface -- where the mind and machine meet.
