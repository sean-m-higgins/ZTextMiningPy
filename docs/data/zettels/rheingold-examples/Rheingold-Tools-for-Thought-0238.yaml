  A change can propagate up through capability hierarchy, higher-order capabilities can now reorganize to take special advantage of this change and of the intermediate higher-capability changes.
  A change can propagate down through the hierarchy as a result of new capabilities at the high level and modification possibilities latent in lower levels.
  These latent capabilities may have been previously unusable in the hierarchy and become usable because of the new capability at the higher level.
  While Engelbart was, in fact, suggesting that computers could be used to automate a low-level task like typewriting, the point he wanted to make had to do with changes in the overall system -- the capabilities such an artifact would open up for thinking in a more effective, wider-ranging, more articulate, quicker, better-formatted manner.
  That is why he distinguished his proposed new category of computer applications by using the term augmentation rather than the more widespread word automation.
  From Engelbart's point of view, the fact that it took over fifteen more years for word processing to catch on was not as important as the fact that people continue to myopically concentrate on the low-level automation and ignore the more important leverage it makes possible at higher levels.
  The hypothesis he presented in the 1963 framework was that computers represent a new stage in the evolution of human intellectual capabilities.
  The concept manipulation stage was the earliest, based in biological capabilities of the brain, followed by the stage of symbol manipulation based on speech and writing, and the stage of manual external symbol manipulation, based on printing.
  The computer-based typewriter was an example of the coming fourth stage of automated external symbol manipulation, to be brought about by, but not limited to, the application of computers to the process of thinking and communicating: In this stage, the symbols with which the human represents the concepts he is manipulating can be arranged before his eyes, moved, stored, recalled, operated upon according to extremely complex rules -- all in very rapid response to a minimum amount of information supplied by the human, by means of cooperative technological devices.
  In the limit of what we might now imagine, this could be a computer, with which individuals could communicate rapidly and easily, coupled to a three-dimensional color display within which extremely sophisticated images could be constructed, the computer being able to execute a wide variety of processes on parts or all of these images in response to human direction.
