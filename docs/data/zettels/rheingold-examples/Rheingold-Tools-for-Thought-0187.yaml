  Sutherland hired Bob Taylor, a young man from the research funding arm of NASA, to be his assistant, and ultimately his successor when he left IPTO in 1965.
  Licklider went to the IBM research center in 1964, and then back to MIT to take charge of Project MAC in 1968.
  In 1983, over a quarter of a century since the spring day he decided to observe his own daily activities, Licklider is still actively counseling those who build information processing technologies.
  After three decades of direct experience with "the rule of two," he is not sure that information engineers have even approached the physical limits of information storage and processing.
  One thing scientists and engineers know now that they didn't know when he and the others started, Licklider points out, is that "Nature is very much more hospitable to information processing than anybody had any idea of in the 1950s.
  We didn't realize that molecular biologists had provided an existence proof for a fantastically efficient, reliable, information processing mechanism -- the molecular coding of the human genetic system.
  The informational equivalent of the world's entire fund of knowledge can be stored in less than a cubic centimeter of DNA, which tells us that we haven't begun to approach the physical limits of information processing technology."
  The time-sharing communities, and the network of communities that followed them, were part of another dream -- the prospect of computer-mediated communities throughout the world, extending beyond the computer experts to thinkers, artists, and business people.
  Licklider believes it is entirely possible that the on-line, interactive human-computer community he dreamed about will become technologically feasible sometime within the next decade.
  He knew all along that the frameworks of ideas and the first levels of hardware technology achieved in the 1960s and 1970s were only the foundation for a lot of work that remained to be done.
