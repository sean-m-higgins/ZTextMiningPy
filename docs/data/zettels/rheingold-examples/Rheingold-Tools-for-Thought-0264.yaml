note: |
  One of the first things Pake did was hire the best long-term computer visionary, research organizer, and people-collector he could find -- Bob Taylor.
  At first, the newly recruited engineers, hackers, and visionaries worked in temporary quarters located in the Palo Alto flatlands, near the Stanford University campus.
  In the mid 1970s construction began on a prime piece of ground above Hewlett-Packard, next to Syntex, in that fertile enclave known as "The Stanford Industrial Park."
  If there was ever a model environment for the technological cutting edge of the "knowledge sector," PARC was it.
  From the physicists in the laser laboratories and the engineer-artisans in the custom microchip shops to the computer language designers, artificial intelligence programmers, cognitive physiologists, video jockeys, sound engineers, machinists, librarians, secretaries, cooks, janitors, and security guards, you got a nice, model-utopian feeling from everybody you encountered.
  The physical plant itself is an inescapable exercise in innovation.
  It took me a while to stop thinking of the place as being upside down.
  Since the terraced glass-and-concrete structure was built halfway embedded in Coyote Hill, Zuni Pueblo style, the main entrance is on the top floor.
  To get to the second floor from the ground floor, you go down.
  The linked quadrangles of offices, laboratories, and meeting rooms wind around atriums and gardens.
