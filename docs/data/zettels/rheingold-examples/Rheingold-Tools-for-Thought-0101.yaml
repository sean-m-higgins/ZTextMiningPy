  This electronic routing was the materialization of the machine's instructions for transforming the input data into the solution.
  Many different kinds of equations could be solved, and the performance of a calculation could be altered by the outcome of subproblems, but ENIAC was nowhere near as flexible as Babbage's Analytical Engine, which could be reprogrammed to solve a different set of equations, not by altering the machine itself, but by altering the sequence of input cards.
  What Mauchly and Eckert gained in calculating power and speed, they paid for in overall flexibility.
  The gargantuan electronic machine had to be set up for solving each separate problem by changing the configuration of a huge telephone-like switchboard, a procedure that could take days.
  The origins of the device as a ballistics project were partially responsible for this inflexibility.
  It was not the intention of the Moore School engineers to build a universal machine.
  Their contract quite clearly specified that they create an altogether new kind of trajectory calculator.
  Especially after von Neumann joined the team, they realized that what they were constructing would not only become the ultimate mathematical calculator, but the first, necessarily imperfect prototype of a whole new category of machine.
  Before ENIAC was completed, its designers were already planning a successor.
  Von Neumann, especially, began to realize that what they were talking about was a general-purpose machine, one that was by its nature particularly well suited to function as an extension of the human mind.
