note: |
  The first law of thermodynamics stated that the energy in a closed system is constant.
  That means that energy cannot be created or destroyed in such systems, but can only be transformed.
  The second law states, in effect, that part of that unchangeable reservoir of energy becomes a little less stable every time a transformation takes place.
  When you pour hot water into cold water, you can't separate it back into a hot and a cold glass of water again (without using a lot more energy).
  Entropy, meaning "transformation," was the word Claudius later proposed for that lost quantity of usable energy.
  Entropy Entropy as defined by Clausius is not just something that happens to steam engines or to glasses of water.
  It is a universal tendency that is as true for the energy transactions of the stars in the sky as it is for the tea kettle on the stove.
  Because the universe is presumed to be a closed system, and since Clausius demonstrated that the entropy of such systems tends to increase with the passage of time, the gloomy prediction of a distant but inevitable "heat death of the universe" was a disturbing implication of the second law of thermodynamics.
  But the gloomy news about the end of time wasn't the only implication of the entropy concept.
  When it was discovered that heat is a measure of the average motion of a population of molecules, the notion of entropy became linked to the measure of order or disorder in a system.
