  It took five and a half years.
  Besides the course requirements of his graduate work, Barr's paying job required him to produce a general text from the contributions of hundreds of AI researchers, a book that someone in a noncomputer related field could use to get an overview of the most significant work that had been done in AI.
  The job stretched out longer and longer, and during the time it took to complete his editing duties, he progressed from his master's degree to a Ph.D. in cognitive science.
  By the late 1970s, Barr was not alone in feeling that the exploration and engineering of knowledge -- learning how it is acquired by humans or machines, how it is represented in the mind or in software, how it is communicated between humans and computers and disseminated throughout a culture -- was a central problem in philosophy, psychology and artificial intelligence that might well be answered in surprising ways by the new discipline created by the builders of expert systems.
  Computers can track large amounts of information, and they can move through that information very quickly.
  But when it comes to solving any but the simplest problems -- the kind that a human toddler or a chessmaster can handle easily -- computers run up against a severe problem.
  Large is never large enough when it comes to the computer memory needed, and fast is never fast enough in terms of computational speed.
  There is simply too much information in the world to solve problems by checking every possible solution.
  The difference between brute-force calculation and human knowledge is the missing link (and holy grail) of hard-core AI research.
  Personal knowledge is a tricky thing to describe, and hence a difficult thing for a computer to emulate.
