  First we had to consider the human functions we wanted to amplify.
  For example, people use their eyes a great deal to assimilate information, so we wanted a particularly powerful kind of display screen.
  Then all the time-sharing veterans insisted they wanted a computer that didn't run faster at night."
  What Taylor meant was that the time-sharing programmers had all been accustomed in the mid 1960s to doing their serious computing in the middle of the night, when the amount of traffic on the central computer was light enough to perform truly large information processing tasks without delay.
  The first radical idea they agreed upon was that each Alto had to have as much main memory as one of the central computers from the time-sharing systems of only a few years back.
  And it had to be fast.
  The existing computer languages didn't give first-time users and experimental programmers equal power to interact with the computer, so we created new kinds of languages."
  There are times when we want to use the Alto as a personal tool, and times when we want to use it as a communication medium, and times when we want to do both.
  Our purpose in bringing all that computing power to individuals was not to allow them to isolate themselves.
  We wanted to provide the gateway to a new communication space, and ways to fly around in it, and a medium for community creativity, all at the same time."
