  The artist can now be the publisher and go directly to the audience.
  Two electronic magazines I encountered my first time out were called Sourcetrek and Mylar's Warp.
  Sourcetrek, subtitled "Journeys through the Electronic Void," is put out by "Sourcetronaut Dave," aka "Sourcevoid Dave."
  When you give The Source the command to connect you to Sourcetrek, you get a choice of menus on your screen, along with a list of different statistics about the choices -- reading time, number of times read, the exact time it was last read.
  I selected the first "article," entitled "Hello," which went (in part) as follows: Hello.
  I am "Sourcevoid" Dave.
  David Hughes otherwise.
  I was born in Colorado, descended from stubborn Welshmen who were never too loyal to the king.
  Which is probably why I am content being a maverick of sorts, with a Welsh imagination.
  I live in Historic Old Colorado City at the base of 14,114 foot Pike's Peak.
