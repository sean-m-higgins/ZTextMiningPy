note: |
  Instead of programming via boxes of punched cards over a period of days, it became possible to feed the programs and data to the machine via a high-speed paper tape; it was also possible to change the paper tape input while the program was running.
  The operator could interact with the machine for the first time.
  A couple of other young computerists at MIT, John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky, were also using a PDP-1 in ways computers weren't usually used.)
  The PDP-1 was primitive in comparison with today's computers, but it was a breakthrough in 1960.
  Here was the model builder that Licklider had first envisioned.
  This fast, inexpensive, interactive computer was beginning to resemble the kind of device he dreamed about back in his psychoacoustic lab at MIT , when he first realized how his ability to theorize always seemed constrained by the effort it took to draw graphs from data.
  As he had suspected, it was indeed possible to use computers to help build models from experimental data and to make sense of any complicated collection of information.
  Then he learned that although the computer was the right kind of machine he needed to build his models, even the PDP-1 was hopelessly crude for the phenomena he wanted to study.
  Nature was far too complicated for 1960-style computers.
  He needed more memory components and faster processing of large amounts of calculations.
