  The religion that germinated on the ORIGINS conference tree -- was its origin any stranger or less likely than the dominant religions of today that sprang up centuries ago in dusty Middle Eastern villages?
  Xanadu and EIES might seem like novel and unfamiliar media -- but so did the printing press and telephones when they first appeared.
  The forms that cultural innovations took in the past can help us try to forecast the future -- but the forms of the past can only give us a glimpse, not a detailed picture, of what will be.

  The lesson, if anything, is that we should get used to expecting the unexpected.
  We seem to be experiencing one of those rare pivotal times between epochs, before a new social order emerges, when a great many experiments briefly flourish.
