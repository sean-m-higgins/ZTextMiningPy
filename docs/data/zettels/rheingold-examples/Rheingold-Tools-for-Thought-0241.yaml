  The Augmentation Research Center (ARC) consisted of the "engine room," where the new time-sharing computers were located, a hardware shop where the constantly upgraded computer systems and experimental input-output devices were built and maintained, and a model "intellectual workshop" that consisted of an amphitheater-like space in which a dozen people sat in front of large display terminals, creating the system's software, communicating with each other, and navigating through dimensions of information by means of what was known as NLS (for oNLine System).
  NLS was an exotic and intoxicating new brew of ARPA-provided gadgetry, homebrewed software wizardry, and altogether new intellectual skills that were partially designed in advance and partially thrown together as the designer-subjects of the experiment went along.
  After four years of stumbling, backtracking, leaping forward, then more confidently exploring this new territory, after hardware crises and software crises and endless argumentation about how to go about doing what they all agreed ought to be done, NLS was beginning to fulfill the hopes its builders had for it.
  It was time to gamble.
  Whenever he consulted the feeling in his stomach, Doug Engelbart had no doubt that it was a gamble.
  Sitting all alone on that stage in San Francisco, watching his support team scramble around the hastily woven nest of cables and cameras surrounding the base of the platform, facing an audience of several thousand computer experts, it was all too evident to Doug that any number of possible accidents -- a thunderstorm, a faulty cable, a concatenation of software glitches -- could effectively kill their future chances of obtaining research funds.
  But he had begun to lose his patience, waiting for decades for the rest of the world to catch on to something as important as augmentation.
  And his colleagues shrared Engelbart's confidence in the delicate coalition of people, electronic devices, software, and ideas they called the NLS system.
  Doug's painstakingly thought-out conceptual framework, the prototype hardware, systems he and Bill English developed, and his bootstrapping laboratory of systems programmers, computer engineers, psychologists, and media specialists were only corroborating what Doug had known for years -- computers can help intellectual workers think better.
  By the late 1960s, the problem lay in getting his ideas and the meaning of his team's accomplishments across to people in the wider computer world.
