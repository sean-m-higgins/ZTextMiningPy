note: |
  According to Brenda's theory, the reason is rarely memorable, even in a good improvisation, is because the actors are forced to use part of their mind to think about being playwrights.
  To achieve an excellent dramatic outcome the actor has to think about his character and manipulate the plot line at the same time, so that it all comes out in an interesting way.
  Unless you are an acting genius, you have to trade part of your acting power in order to think about the play.
  And you can't do a great job of crafting a drama if you have the acting job to juggle.
  Sitting on top of all your graphics and voice recognition and speech synthesis is an expert system that can make informed decisions about the potential of dramatic situations, using a large enough base of knowledge about the possible situations that can arise and a set of rules for sifting through the knowledge base."
  Less fantastic, but nonetheless powerful versions of the "expert system" Brenda was talking about do exist now -- and in the next chapter we'll take a look at what another infonaut thinks about the potential of these "knowledge-transferring" programs.
  The hypothetical variation Brenda was describing would be able to learn form experience -- experience with the individual who is using it or with everybody who has ever used it.
  Brenda thinks that such a program could approach the kind of analysis that a drama critic does.
  Right now, there are expert systems in existence that can help doctors to diagnose diseases.
  Those systems are able to apply diagnostic rules adapted from human doctors to a large collection of data, a knowledge base, regarding known symptoms.
