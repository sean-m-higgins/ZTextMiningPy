  If you want to extend your senses into the real world in real time, you can look at quasars with x-ray radiotelescope vision, CAT scan everything you see, hover above the earth in a weather satellite, zoom down to take an electron microscopic look at the microbes on a dust mote on a license plate in Kenya.
  If you want to communicate with one person or an entire on-line network, you have all the media at your disposal, along with additional "dialogue support tools" to augment the interaction.
  Or the interaction might be private, limited to you and the informationscape -- for reasons of work or play.
  Perhaps you want to know something about blue whales.
  Everything written in every magazine, library, or research data base is available to you, and an invisible librarian is there you help you, if you wish; just focus your eyes on a reference file and it fills the screen.
  Ask the librarian questions about what you want to know, or allow it to ask you questions.
  But you don't have to just read about whales.
  You can listen to them, watch them, visit them.
  Just ask, and you'll be underwater, swimming among them, or in a helicopter, watching them while you hover above the crystalline Baja waters.
  The experience won't be strictly passive.
