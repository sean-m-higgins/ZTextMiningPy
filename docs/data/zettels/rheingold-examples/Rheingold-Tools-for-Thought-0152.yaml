  This basic element in this game-tree-code, the binary decision, was the basis for Shannon's basic measure of information -- the bit.
  Whenever computer enthusiasts speak of a "bit," they are referring to one of those decisions in the garden of forking paths.
  Note that each decision, each bit, reduces the uncertainty of the situation, whether you are designating turns in a pathway or numbers in a guessing game or the energy state of molecules in a container.
  But what if you were to use a different strategy to guess the right answer?
  What if you just named each of the possible letters, one at a time, in a sequence or randomly?
  This relates to probability theory, the mathematical principles governing the random selection of small samples from large populations.
  The relative probability of an event occurring, whether it is the probability of a molecule being hot or the probability of a symbol being a specific letter of the alphabet, depends upon the total number of cases in the population and the frequency of the specified event.
  If there are only two cases in the population, a single yes or no decision reduces the uncertainty to zero.
  In a group of four, it takes two decisions to be sure.
  In a group of trillions, you have to guess a little.
