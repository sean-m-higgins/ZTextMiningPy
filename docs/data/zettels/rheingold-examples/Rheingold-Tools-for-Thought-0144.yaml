  At this point, nobody knew, exactly, what information was.
  Just as he had found the perfect tool for describing relay circuits, after the war Shannon wanted to find mathematical tools for precisely defining the invisible but powerful commodity that these new machines were processing.
  He succeeded in finding the descriptive tools he sought, not in an obscure corner of mathematics, as in the case of Boole's algebra, but in the fundamental laws governing energy.
  Like Turing, Shannon put a surprise finishing touch on a project that scientists had worked at for centuries.
  In this case, the quest was not to understand the nature of symbol systems, but a more pragmatic concern with the nature of energy and its relation to information.
  Although Shannon was specifically looking at the laws underlying the communication of messages in man-made systems, and generally interested in the difference between messages and noise, he ended up dealing with the laws governing the flow of energy in the universe.
  In particular, he discovered the secrets of decoding telephone switching networks, hidden in the work of previous scientists who had discovered certain laws governing heat energy in steam engines.
  Back when the Industrial Revolution was getting started, and steam-powered engines were the rage, it became a practical necessity to find out something about the efficiency of these energy-converting devices.
  In the process, it was discovered that something fundamental to the nature of heat prevents any machine from ever becoming perfectly efficient.
  The study of the movement of heat in steam engines became the science of thermodynamics, given precise expression in 1850 by Rudolf Clausius, in his two laws of thermodynamics.
