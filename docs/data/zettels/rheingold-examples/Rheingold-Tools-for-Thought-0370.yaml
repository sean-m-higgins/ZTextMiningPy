  Surprisingly, Barr agrees with Weizenbaum about the potential ethical danger of mixing human lives and artificial intelligence research: "Artificial intelligence doesn't exist yet," Barr emphasizes, "but I believe that the kind of research we have started to explore with knowledge-based expert systems can eventually create a tool that truly understands human inquiries.
  And I'm not sure that people are prepared for the ethical decisions that will accompany that kind of power."
  From our conversations, and from my perusal of his written work, it has been evident to me that Barr also feels that the potential for using this technology to assist humanity is well worth pursuing, despite the dangers of misuse.
  Besides developing and distributing automated expertise to both specialists and ordinary citizens as an informational antitoxin to life in a complicated world, Barr likes to wonder aloud how else might these software entries be used to further positive ends.
  His personal dream is to eventually build an expert system that is an expert in helping humans reach agreement.
  If chemists and physicians can use intelligent assistants, why can't diplomats and arms-control negotiators avail themselves of the same assistance?
  Avron Barr's odyssey through philosophy, psychology, and computer programming has led him to suspect a deep connection between what we know individually and how we agree collectively.
  I met Avron Barr in a short-order restaurant in the heart of artificial intelligence country -- an establishment named "late for the Train," located next to the Menlo Park train station.
  If there is an eavesdropping hit list for technological spies, this seismographic hotcake-and-sprouts joint has to be in the top five.
  SRI International, one of the oldest robotics research centers, and the birthplace of PROSPECTOR, the molybdenum-sniffing software assistant, is a few shady, tree-lined, affluent blocks away.
