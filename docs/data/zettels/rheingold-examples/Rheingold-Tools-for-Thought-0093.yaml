note: |
  John W. Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert have been properly credited with the invention of ENIAC, but before they implemented the key ideas of electronic digital computing machines, a man named Atanasoff in Iowa, in the 1930s, built small, crude, but functioning prototypes of electronic calculating machines.
  His name has not been as widely known, and his fortunes turned out differently from those of other pioneers when computers grew from an exotic newborn technology to a powerful infant industry.
  But in 1973 a Unites Stated district court ruled that John Vincent Atanasoff invented the electronic digital computer.
  It was a complicated decision, reached after years of litigation, and was not as clear-cut as it might have been if both did not have such strong cases.
  The core of the dispute centered around original work Atanasoff did in the 1930s, and the influence that his work later had on John Mauchly's design of ENIAC.
  Like the Hollerith-Billings story of the invention of punched-card data processing, simple explanations of where one man's ideas left off and another's began are difficult to reconstruct at best.
  Atanasoff was the last of the lone inventors in the field of computation; after him, such projects were too complicated for anything less than a team effort.
  Like Boole, Atanasoff was the recipient of one of those sudden inspirations that provided the solution to a problem he had been grappling with for years.
  A theoretical physicist teaching at Iowa State in the early 1930s, he came up against the same obstacle faced by other mathematicians and physicists of his era.
  The approaches to the most interesting ideas were blocked by the problems of performing large numbers of complex calculations.
