note: |
  Turing put up with the hormones and the public disgrace, and quietly began to break ground for another cycle of brilliant work in the mathematical foundations of biology -- work that might have had even more momentous consequences, if it had been completed, than his work with computable numbers.
  For nearly two years after his arrest, during which time the homophobic and "national security" pressures grew even stronger, Turing worked with the ironic knowledge that he was being destroyed by the very government his wartime work had been instrumental in preserving.
  In June, 1954, Alan Turing lay down on his bed, took a bite from an apple, dipped it in cyanide, and bit again.
  Like Ada, Alan Turing's unconventionality was part of his undoing, and like her he saw the software possibilities that stretched far beyond the limits of the computing machinery available at the time.
  Like her, he died too young.
  Other wartime research projects and other brilliant mathematicians were aware of Turing's work, particularly in the United States, where scientists were suddenly emerging into the nuclear age as figures of power.
  Military-sponsored research-and-development teams on both sides of the Atlantic continued to work on digital computers of their own.
  A few of these independent research efforts grew out of Ballistics work.
  Others were connected with the effort to build the first nuclear fission and fusion bombs.
  Over a hundred years had passed between Babbage and Turing.
