  Consensys started out as a way of describing how you communicate with one of these systems, in particular, how you might push the expert system to deal with two different human experts and incorporate the value of the differences that the two experts might have.
  Each of us has our own little peephole onto the building being constructed.
  None of us know what it is, but each of us has a slightly different perspective.
  And all of those perspectives are necessary to figure out what's being built.
  It's strange that we can achieve so much as a culture in such short time, and we can get all these great ideas about how we got here and how the universe works, and yet know so little about the point of it all.
  I think that's a clue that computation has a role to play.
  Computation involves systematic manipulation of symbols, and symbols have a cognitive relation to the world.
  We need those intermediate messages between our internal representations in order to share perspectives on the world.
  The understanding that is necessary for that to begin to happen involves admitting that we don't know what the purpose is, then finding out why we don't know, and figuring out together how we might come to understand.
  Perhaps computers can play a role in understanding that purpose.
