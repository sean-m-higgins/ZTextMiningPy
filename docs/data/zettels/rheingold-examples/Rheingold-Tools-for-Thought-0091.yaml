  Von Neumann's wife, Klara, performed a similar role at Los Alamos, both before and after electronic computing machines became available.
  The tradition of using women for such work was widespread -- the equivalent roles in Britain's code-breaking efforts were played by hundreds of skilled calculators whom Turing and his colleagues called "girls" as well as "computers."
  The expansion of the human computing staff at Aberdeen to nearly two hundred people, mostly WACs, was a stopgap measure.
  The calculation of firing tables was already out of hand.
  As soon as a new kind of gun, fuse, or shell became available for combat, a new table had to be calculated.
  The final product was either printed in a booklet that gunners kept in their pockets, or was mechanically encoded in special aiming apparatus called automata.
  The answer to the firing table dilemma, as Goldstine was one of the first to recognize, was to commission the invention of an entirely new kind of mechanical calculating aid.
  The Vannevar Bush calculators were no longer the most efficient calculating devices.
  Faster machines, built on different principles, had been built by Dr. Howard Aiken and an IBM team at Harvard, and by a group led by a man named George Stibitz at Bell laboratories.
  But Goldstine knew that what they really needed at Aberdeen and the Moore School was an automatic calculator that was hundreds, even thousands of times faster than the fastest existing machines.
