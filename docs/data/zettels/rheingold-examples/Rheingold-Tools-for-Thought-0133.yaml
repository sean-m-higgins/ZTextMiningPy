note: |
  Wiener was convinced that biology, even sociology and anthropology, were to be as profoundly affected by cybernetics as electronics theory or computer engineering; in fact anthropologist Gregory Bateston was closely involved with Wiener and later with the first AI researchers.
  While Shannon published information theory, and von Neumann pushed the development of computer technology, Wiener retreated from the politics of big science in the postwar world to articulate his grand framework.
  After the war, as the plans for the Institute for Advanced Study's computer proposed by von Neumann were put into action, with Julian Bigelow as von Neumann's chief engineer on the project, and as Mauchly and Eckert struck out on their own to start the commercial computer industry, Wiener headed for Mexico City to work with Rosenblueth.
  Then, in the spring of 1947, Wiener went to England, where he visited the British computer-building projects, and spoke with Alan Turing.
  When he returned to Mexico City, Wiener wrote his book and decided to title it and the new field Cybernetics, from the Greek word meaning "steersman."
  It was subtitled: or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine.
  Cybernetics was the description of a general science of mechanisms for maintaining order in a disorderly universe, the process for steering a course through the random forces of the physical world, based on information about the past and forecasts about the future.
  When a steersman moves a rudder, the craft changes course.
  When the steersman detects that the previous change of course has oversteered, the rudder is moved again, in the opposite direction.
  The feedback of the steersman's senses is the controlling element that keeps the craft on course.
