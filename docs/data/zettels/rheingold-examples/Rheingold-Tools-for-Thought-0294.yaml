  The price for the system was around $10,000.
  This was $6000 less than the more powerful Star, but still hardly in the range of the consumer market.
  In 1984, Apple brought out a scaled-down, cheaper version of Lisa, the Macintosh, with the same user interface, and revolutionized the personal computer market.
  If time-sharing research had been the unofficial initiation ceremony and the ARPAnet was the rite of passage, the PARC era was the end of the apprenticeship era for the augmentation community.
  New generations of researchers and entrepreneurs were entering the software fray through the infant computer industry.
  By the early 1980s, it didn't take a computer prophet to see that big changes were going to continue to happen as the mass market began to awaken to the potential of personal computing.
  Although the hardware and the software of the first tens of millions of personal computers fell far short of what the PARC veterans were working toward, the stakes of the game had changed with the emergence of a mass market.
  The beginnings of a much wider computer-using community also meant the end of arcane jargon and software designs that required complex interactions with the computer.
  The design principles demonstrated by the Star and the Lisa pointed the way for the future computer designers.
  At PARC, they were already onto the Dorado, the Dolphin, and other post-Star computers.
