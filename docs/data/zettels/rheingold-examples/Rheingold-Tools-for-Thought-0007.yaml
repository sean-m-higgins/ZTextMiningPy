note: |
  Licklider, one of the most influential pioneers, predicted in 1960, a quarter of a century before the hardware would begin to catch up with his ideas.
  The earliest predictions about the impact of computing machinery occurred quite a bit earlier than 1960.
  The first electronic computers were invented by a few individuals, who often worked alone, during World War II.
  Before the actual inventors of the 1940s were the software patriarchs of the 1840s.
  And before them, thousands of years ago, the efforts of thinkers from many different cultures to find better ways to use symbols as tools led to the invention of mathematics and logic.
  It was these formal systems for manipulating symbols that eventually led to computation.
  Links in what we can now see as a continuous chain of thought were created by a series of Greek philosophers, British logicians, Hungarian mathematicians, and American inventors.
  Most of the patriarchs had little in common with each other, socially or intellectually, but in some ways they were very much alike.
  It isn't surprising that they were exceptionally intelligent, but what is unusual is that they all seem to have been preoccupied with the power of their own minds.
  For sheer intellectual adventure, many intelligent people pursue the secrets of the stars, the mysteries of life, the myriad ways to use knowledge to accomplish practical goals.
