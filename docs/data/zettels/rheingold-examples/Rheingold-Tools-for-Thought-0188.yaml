  When the bootstrapping process of building better, cheaper, experimental interactive information processing systems intersects with the rising curve of electronic capabilities, and the dropping curve of computational costs, it will become possible for millions, rather than a thousand or two, to experience the kind of information environment the ARPA-sponsored infonauts knew.
  In the early 1980s, millions of people already own personal computers that will become obsolete when versions a hundred times as fast with a thousand times the memory capacity come along at half of today's prices.
  When tens of millions of people get their hands on powerful enough devices, and a means for connecting them, Licklider still thinks the job will only be in its beginning stages.
  Looking toward the day when the "intergalactic network" he speculated about in the mid sixties becomes feasible, he remains convinced that the predicted boost in human cultural capabilities will take place, but only after enough people use an early version of the system to think up a more capable system that everybody can use: "With a large enough population involved in improving the system, it will be easier for new ideas to be born and propagated," he notes, perhaps remembering the years when interactive computing was considered a daring venture by a bunch of mavericks.
  The most significant issue, he still believes, is whether the medium will become truly universal.
  That's still the important question," Licklider concludes, still not sure whether this new medium will remain the exclusive property of a smaller group who might end up wielding disproportionate power over others by virtue of their access to these tools, or whether it will become the property of the entire culture, like literacy.Chapter Eight: Witness to Software History: The Mascot of Project MACWhen he tried the doorknob and found it unlocked, then opened the door to Building 26 and poked his head into a room full of weirdos having a high old time with candy bars and computer programs, David Rodman knew he had discovered something.
  The year was 1960.
  David Rodman was ten years old.
  And 1960 was still at least four years too early for weird people to be anything but a rarity, even on college campuses.It turned out that these pasty-faced, hollow-eyed, jargon-spewing, insanely cackling young men were the first, founding generation of dropout programming wizards to call themselves "hackers," and Building 26 was where the hotshot hired programmers of MIT's artificial intelligence Project MAC were caged until they all moved to the ninth floor of 545 Technology Square, in the early sixties.
  Technology Square was MIT's space-age temple of sci-tech.
