  When everything being dealt with in a computer system is visible, the display screen relieves the load on the short-term memory by acting as a sort of "visual cache."
  Thinking becomes easier and more productive.
  A well designed computer system can actually improve the quality of your thinking.
  A subtle thing happens when everything is visible: the display becomes the reality.
  The user model becomes identical with that which is on the screen.
  Objects can be understood purely in terms of their visible characteristics.
  The idea that the right kind of computer systems could affect the way people think -- the seed planted by Vannevar Bush and nurtured by Licklider and Engelbart -- was not lost on the Xerox interface builders.
  In regard to the principle that they called "consistency," the Star team noted: One way to get consistency into a system is to adhere to paradigms for operations.
  By applying a successful way of working in one area to other areas, a system acquires a unity that is both apparent and real.
  These paradigms change the very way you think.
