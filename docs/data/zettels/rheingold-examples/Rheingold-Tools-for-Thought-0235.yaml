  Artifacts -- physical objects designed to provide for human comfort, the manipulation of things or materials, and the manipulation of symbols.
  Language -- the way in which the individual classifies the picture of his world into the concepts that his mind uses to model that world, and the symbols that he attaches to those concepts and uses in consciously manipulating the concepts ("thinking").
  Methodology -- the methods, procedures, and strategies with which an individual organizes his goal-centered (problem-solving) activity.
  Training -- the conditioning needed by the individual to bring his skills in using augmentation means 1, 2, and 3 to the point where they are operationally effective.
  The system we wish to improve can thus be visualized as comprising a trained human being together with his artifacts, language, and methodology.
  The explicit new system we contemplate will involve as artifacts computers and computer-controlled information-storage, information-handling, and information-display devices.
  The aspects of the conceptual framework that are discussed here are primarily those relating to those relating to the individual's ability to make significant use of such equipment in an integrated system.
  The biggest difference between the citizen of preliterate culture and the industrial-world dweller who can perform long division or dial a telephone is not in the brain's "hardware" -- the nervous system of the highlander or the urbanite -- but in the thinking tools given by the culture.
  Reading, writing, surviving in a jungle or a city, are examples of culturally transmitted human software.
  The hypothetical transplanted native, Engelbart points out, can move step by step through an organized program by which he or she may learn to drive a car or check out a book from a library.
