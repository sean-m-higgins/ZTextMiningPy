note: |
  He has always been too impatient to wait for someone else to bring him what he wanted.
  And he's always found ways to create what he wanted if it didn't exist.
  For the past fifteen years, his sights have been set on handheld, full-color, stereophonic, artificially intelligent, information representation toys.
  And he wants them by the tens of millions.
  They don't exist yet, so he's enlisted some formidable allies to help him create them.Fame, fortune, or even the more esoteric career ambitions of top-notch software professionals do not seem to motivate Dr. Kay, now a "research fellow" for Apple, formerly "chief scientist" at Atari Corporation.
  Becoming another Silicon Valley millionaire or accepting the offer of an endowed chair at MIT have not interested him as much as the prospect of putting the power to imagine into the hands of every bright kid who got thrown out of a classroom.
  Ever since he learned to read at the age of two and a half, Alan Kay has been accustomed to doing things his own way and letting the rest of the world catch up later.
  At the same time he was close to flunking out of the eighth grade, primarily for insubordination, he was one of television's original "Quiz Kids."
  Ten years before he coined the term "personal computer," before Atari or PARC existed, and before another pair of bright insubordinates named Wozniak and Jobs created a new meaning for that good old American word "Apple," Alan Kay was demonstrating FLEX, a personal computer in all but name, to the ARPA graduate students' conference.
  Alan is now in his early forties, and is acknowledged by his peers, if not yet the general public, as one of the contemporary prophets of the personal computer revolution.
