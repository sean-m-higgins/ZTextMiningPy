note: |
  By 1935, Atanasoff was in hot pursuit of a scheme to mechanize calculation.
  He was aware of Babbage's ideas, but he was an electronic hobbyist as well as a physicist, and entire technologies that didn't exist in Babbage's time were now showing great promise.
  Atanasoff was gradually convinced that an electronic computing machine was a good bet to pursue, but he had no idea how to go about designing one, and he wasn't sure how to design a machine without working out a method of programming it.
  In the late 1970s, Atanasoff told writer Katherine Fishman: I commenced to go into torture.
  For the next two years my life was hard.
  I thought and thought about this.
  Every evening I would go into my office in the physics building.
  One night in the winter of 1937 my whole body was in torment from trying to solve the problems of the machine.
  I got in my car and drove at high speeds for a long while so I could control my emotions.
  It was my habit to do this for a few miles: I could gain control of myself by concentrating on driving.
