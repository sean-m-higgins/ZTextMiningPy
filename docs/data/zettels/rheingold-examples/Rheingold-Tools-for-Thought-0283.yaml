note: |
  The potential of computers as tools to be used by individuals, and the communications possibilities opened by linking computers, were what motivated the PARC team.
  It was time to demonstrate that the theories about using personal computers to manage personal communications could work in an office like theirs.
  If they could demonstrate that such devices could speed their own work, they would be on the way to selling the rest of the world on the vision they held form the time-sharing days.
  The first thing they needed in order to retool the world of information work was a computer designed for one person to use, something that went far beyond previous attempts.
  Because they knew that vision was the human sense capable of the most sophisticated informational input, the PARC computerists knew they wanted a sophisticated graphic screen to bring the computer's power to the user.
  Complex, dynamic, visual models required a large amount of computer power, so the decision to emphasize the visual display meant that the hardware would have a great deal more memory and speed than anyone else in the computer world had heretofore put at any one individual's command.
  We wanted for our own use what we thought other information workers would eventually want.
  We needed the computing power and the research environment to build something expensive but very flexible and growable that would someday be much less expensive but even more capable.
  We all understood when we planned the Alto that the main memory of what we wanted might cost $7000 by the time it was produced, in 1974, but would drop to about $35 ten years later."
  The hardware shop at PARC was only set up to produce small batches for the PARC software designers, but eventually 1500 Altos were built for Xerox executives and researchers, for associates at SAIL and SRI, as well as for the U.S. Senate, House of Representatives, certain other government agencies, and even the White House Staff.
