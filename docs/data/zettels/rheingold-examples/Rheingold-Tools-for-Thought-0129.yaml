  This man, "Bert" by name, suggested that Pitts read a book by the logician Carnap, who was then teaching in Chicago.
  Bert turned out to be Bertrand Russell, and Pitts introduced himself to Carnap in order to point out a mistake the great logician had made in his book.
  Pitts studied with Carnap, and eventually came into contact with McCulloch, who was interested in consulting with logicians in regard to his neurophysiological research.
  Pitts helped McCulloch understand how certain kinds of networks -- the kinds of circuits that might be important parts of nervous systems as well as electrical devices -- could embody the logical devices known as Turing machines.
  McCulloch and Pitts developed a theory that regarded nerves as all-or-none, on-or-off, switchlike devices, and treated the networks as circuits that could be described mathematically and logically.
  Their paper, "A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity," was published in 1943 when Pitts was still only eighteen years old.
  They felt that they were only beginning a line of work that would eventually address the questions of how brain physiology is linked to knowledge.
  When Wiener, Bigelow, and Rosenblueth got together with McCulloch and Pitts, in 1943 and 1944, a critical mass of ideas was reached.
  Pitts joined Wiener at MIT, then worked with von Neumann at the Institute for Advanced Study after the war.
  By the time this interdisciplinary cross-fertilization was beginning, the ENIAC project had progressed far enough for digital computers to join the grand conjunction of ideas.
