  The machines enabled the British to crack Enigma's code, in part by imitating crucial functions of the enemy coding machine.
  The fact that these young academecians had broken the code was a secret of unparalleled importance, perhaps the most closely kept secret of the war, because the ability of the Bletchley machines to continue to successfully decode German messages depended upon the Nazi high command's continuing ignorance that their unbreakable code had been cracked.
  Despite the importance of this work, early wartime bureaucracy and the thickets of secrecy surrounding the project threatened to cancel the incredible strategic advantage the 1943 Enigma breakthrough had handed the Allies.
  Turing appealed directly to Winston Churchill, who gave the project top priority.
  The codes continued to be cracked throughout the duration of the war, and in 1944 and 1945 the valuable information was disguised in the form of other kinds of intelligence, then relayed to British commanders in the Atlantic.
  The tide of the critical U-boat conflict was turned, and the invasion of Europe became possible, largely because of Turing's success with the naval version of the Enigma.
  The Germans never caught on, and Turing's esoteric work in metamathematics turned out to have dramatically practical applications after all.
  Because of the growing strategic significance of advanced cryptanalysis methods in the cold war era, the project continued to be held secret for decades after the war.
  After 1945, a very few people knew that Turing had done something important for the war effort but nobody knew exactly what it was, because he still wasn't allowed to allude to it.
  His role at Bletchley wasn't Turing's only wartime contribution.
