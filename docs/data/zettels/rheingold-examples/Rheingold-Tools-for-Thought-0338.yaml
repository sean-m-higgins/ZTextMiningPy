  Since MIT, Lucasfilm, and Evans & Sutherland were in the bidding for Kay's services when he left Xerox, one can safely assume that Atari must have offered him something more.
  Although his obvious desire was to run an advanced software shop, Kay knew that his next software dream would require very advanced hardware.
  We'll get you hardware designers," you can imagine them saying.
  Atari got him nothing but the best -- including Ted Hoff, the legendary Intel scientist who was the leader of the team that invented the microprocessor chip.
  Kay assembled his own software research team.
