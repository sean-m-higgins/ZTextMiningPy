  When we look at the history of computing, it is clear that the experts consistently underestimate the rate at which this technology changes.
  Even the boldest AI pundits might be seriously underestimating the technological changes that will occur in the next fifty or one hundred years.
  The paths to the future of mind-augmenting technology appear to be fanning out, the range of alternatives becoming wider and less predictable.
  It is possible, given past developments, that all of these paths will lead to distinct new technologies, and will precipitate significant changes in human culture.
  One direction seems to involve the kind of interactive, first-person fantasy amplifiers exemplified by the work of people like Alan Kay and Brenda Laurel.
  Engelbart's dreams of intellectual augmentation furnish a different model of how the universal tool might evolve.
  In the next chapter, we'll look at yet another path -- one that is more connected to the history of literature than the history of machines.
  Ted Nelson, our final infonaut, envisions a future in which the entire population joins the grand conversation of human culture that has heretofore been restricted to those few creators whose works have found their way to library shelves.
  Wild as his predictions may be, they have to be considered seriously, in light of the uncannily accurate forecasts he made back in the "old days" of personal computer history -- the 1960s and 1970s.Chapter Fourteen: Xanadu, Network Culture, and Beyond "Computer was a bad name for it.
  It might just as well have been called an Oogabooga Box.
