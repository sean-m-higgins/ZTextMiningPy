  One important difference between an expert system and other kinds of computer programs is that the program does not simply provide answers to questions, the way a calculator provides the solutions to equations.
  Expert systems do, of course, suggest answers, and eventually they will venture answers accompanied by a numerical statement of "confidence" in the answer.
  But they do more than that.
  The most important part of an expert system is in the interaction between the program and the person who uses it.
  The human who is faced with a specialized problem can consult the specialized program, which is able to ask the human questions of its own regarding the particulars of the problem.
  The consultation is a dialogue that is tailored to the specific case at hand.
  The program simulates the decision process of human experts, and feeds back the results of that process to the human who consults it, thus serving as a reference and guide for the person who uses it.
  Expert systems as they exist today are made of three parts -- a base of task-specific knowledge, a set of rules for making decisions about that knowledge, and a means of answering people's questions about the reasons for the program's recommendations.
  The "expert" program does not know what it knows through he raw volume of facts in the computer's memory, but by virtue of a reasoning-like process of applying the rule system to the knowledge base; it chooses among alternatives, not through brute-force calculation, but by using some of the same rules of thumb that human experts use.
  Statistics about how often experts turn out to be right are the ultimate criteria for evaluating expertise -- whether the expert is a person who has studied for years, or a computer program that was literally born yesterday.
