note: |
  Kay set forth his theories about personal computers as the components of a new medium for human expression , and compares the recent and future emergence of personal computers with the slower development cycles of past media.
  He also predicted that the changes in the human social order that were likely to accompany a new computerized literacy would be much more sweeping than the effects of previous media revolutions.
  The creation of a literate population would be the first reason for such a change.
  Out of that literate population, perhaps a few creative individuals would show the rest of us what could be achieved.
  He declined to predict the specific shape of these social changes, noting the failure of previous attempts at such forecasting: We may expect that the changes resulting from computer literacy will be as far reaching as those that came from literacy in reading and writing, but for most people the changes will be subtle and not necessarily in the direction of their idealized expectations.
  For example, we should not predict or expect that the personal computer will foster a new revolution in education just because it could.
  Every new communication medium in this century -- the telephone, the motion picture, radio and television -- has elicited similar predictions that did not come to pass.
  Millions of uneducated people in the world have ready access to the accumulated culture of the centuries in public libraries, but they do not avail themselves of it.
  Once an individual or a society decides that education is essential, however, the book, and now the personal computer, can become among the society's main vehicles for the transmission of knowledge.
  The difference between a Dynabook of the future and all the libraries of the past, however, would depend upon the dynamic nature of this medium.
