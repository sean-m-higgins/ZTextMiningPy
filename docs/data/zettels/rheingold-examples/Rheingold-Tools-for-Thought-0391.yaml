note: |
  The chip itself was useless to anyone but an electronic engineer.
  It had an "instruction set" of "firmware" primitive commands built into it, an arithmetic and logic unit, a clock, temporary storage registers, but no external memory, no input or output devices, no circuitry to connect the components together into a working computer.
  Roberts decided to provide the other components and a method for interconnecting them and sell the kits to hobbyists.
  In January of 1975, Popular Electronics magazine did a cover story on "a computer you can build yourself for $420."
  It was called the Altair (after a planet in a Star Trek episode).
  Roberts was hoping for 200 orders in 1975, to keep the enterprise alive, and he received more than that with the first mail after the issue hit the stands.
  Bill Gates and Paul Allen were nineteen and twenty-two years old when they wrote a version of BASIC for the Altair.
  They went to New Mexico to work with MITS, developing software for the first hobbyist computers.
  It had been obvious from day one that a great many people wanted to have computers of their own.
  MITS had the usual problems associated with a successful start-up company.
