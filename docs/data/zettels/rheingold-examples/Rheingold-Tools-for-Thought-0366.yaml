  Although the people who built the system see it as a marvelous but thoroughly fallible tool, many people tend to give too much weight to the recommendation of a computer simply because it comes from a computer.
  Since medical advice often deals in life and death matters, you have to take into consideration the potential psychological impact of such an "automatic doctor" when you attempt to build something that gives medical advice to an expert.
  Like all complex issues, the ethics of medical knowledge engineering have another side.
  It might be noted by someone from a non-Western, nonindustrial, or nonurban culture that expertise, particularly medical expertise, is a desperately scarce resource.
  The few medical, hygiene, and agricultural experts who are fighting the biggest humanitarian problems of the world -- epidemics and famine -- are spread too thin and are working too hard to keep up with scientific progress in their fields.
  Even in major medical centers, expertise in certain important specialties is a rare commodity.
  While so many of the trappings of "modern medicine" -- like CAT scanners and other medical imaging technologies -- are so expensive as to be limited to a few wealthy or well-insured patients, the potential cost per patient of a software-based system is absurdly low, almost low enough to do some good in a near-future when the number of critically ill people on earth might number in the hundreds of millions.
  Medicine -- with all its promise and all its difficult ethical implications -- appears to be one of the most promising areas of application for commercial knowledge engineering.
  In the mid 1970s, a physician and computer scientist at Stanford Medical School, Dr. Edward H. Shortliffe, developed MYCIN, the diagnostic system quoted in the earlier dialogue.
  The problems associated with diagnosing a certain class of brain infections was a technically appropriate area for expert-system research, and an area of particularly pressing human need because the speed with which the infecting agent is identified is critical to successful treatment.
