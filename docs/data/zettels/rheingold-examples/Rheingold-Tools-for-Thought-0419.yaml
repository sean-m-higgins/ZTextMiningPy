note: |
  My modem beeped its way to the host computer, and when the word CONNECT appeared on my screen, I hit the return key twice.
  A menu of conferences appeared, in the form of the list of names of the first message in each conference.
  I selected "ORIGINS," as instructed.
  ORIGINS first gave me an address to write to obtain a brochure, then the following message appeared on my screen: ORIGINS is a movement that started on this computer (Santa Cruz, 408-475-7101).
  Origins began on the START-A-RELIGION conference, but we don't call it a religion.
  ORIGINS is partly a religion, partly like a westernized form of yoga society, partly a peace movement.
  It is a framework for improving your life and improving the world at the same time.
  The movement centers on "practices" -- actions you can use in everyday life to build effective human relationships, strength of community, and self-awareness.
  All the practices are based on action.
  None require any special equipment, settings, leaders, theories or social status.
