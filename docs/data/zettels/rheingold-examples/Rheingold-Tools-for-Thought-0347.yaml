  I don't want to enter a bunch of commands," Brenda insisted.
  I want first-person interaction.
  Great.
  But first I have to do away with all this stuff between me and the outcome.
  Maybe the interface is the barrier.
  I think that it is more than a technological question.
  You can't expect to solve a problem by building a better interface if the whole idea of interface is based on an incomplete metaphor.
  To use a real artsy metaphor that will probably break down under scrutiny, I like to look at the computer as a system for making magic portals.
  Like that moment in The Wizard of Oz when Dorothy opens the door and everything changes from black and white to color.
  That is what I want to happen -- perceptually, cognitively, emotionally.
