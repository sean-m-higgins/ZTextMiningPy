  It was his expertise in the psychology of human-machine interaction that led Licklider to a position where he could make big things out of his dreams.
  In the early and mid 1950s, MIT and IBM were involved in building what were to be the largest computers ever built, the IBM AN/FSQ-7, as the control centers of a whole new continental air defense system for the United States.
  SAGE (Semi-Automatic Ground Environment) was the Air Force's answer to the new problem of potential nuclear bomber attack.
  The computers weighed three hundred tons, took up twenty thousand feet of floor space, and were delivered in eighteen large vans apiece.
  Ultimately, the Air Force bought fifty-six of them.
  MIT set up Lincoln Laboratory in Lexington, Massachusetts, to design SAGE.
  At the other end of the continent, System Development Corporation in Santa Monica (the center of the aircraft industry) was founded to create software for SAGE.
  Some of the thorniest problems that were encountered on this project had to do with devising ways to make large amounts of information available in human-readable form, quickly enough for humans to make fast decisions about that information.
  It just wouldn't do for your computers to take three days to evaluate all the radar and radio-transmitted data before the Air Defense Command could decide whether or not an air attack was underway.
  Some of the answers to these problems were formulated in the "Whirlwind" project at the MIT computing center, where high-speed calculations were combined with computer controls that resembled aircraft controls.
