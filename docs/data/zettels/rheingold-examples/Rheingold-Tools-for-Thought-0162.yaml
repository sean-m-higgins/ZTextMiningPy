  His lectures are jewels, all of them.
  They sound spontaneous, but in reality they are very, very carefully prepared.
  In the early sixties, one of the extremely few students Shannon personally took on, another MIT bred prodigy by the name of Ivan Sutherland, made quite a splash on the computer science scene.
  By the mid-1970s, Shannon, now in his sixties, had become a literal gray eminence.
  By the early 1980s, he still hadn't stopped thinking about things, and considering his track record, it isn't too farfetched to speculate that his most significant discoveries have yet to be published.
  In the late 1950s, around the time Shannon began to retreat from public life, the artificial intelligence pioneers began to stake out ambitious territories for their laboratories -- goals like automatic theorem-proving programs, or knowledge-representation languages, or robotics -- and it began to be possible to dream of computers that could be used as laboratories for running experiments in new kinds of AI programs.
  Then fate put a little pressure on the story once again.
  This time, it was not a war, but an implicit threat of war.
  The space race and the computer revolution were ready to be launched by 1957, and the information processing devices pioneered by the World War II creators of computing were ready to leave the laboratories and begin to infiltrate the real world.
  As usual, things started popping when an MIT professor stumbled onto something big.Chapter Seven: Machines to Think With In the spring of 1957, while he continued to carry out the duties of an MIT researcher and professor, Dr. J.C.R.
