  He was a key member of the team who designed the software for the first electronic computer and who created the model for the physical architecture of computers.
  He also added elegance and power to Turing's first steps towards creating a true programming language.Chapter Four: Johnny Builds bombs and Johnny Builds Brains If you asked ten thousand people to name the most influential thinker of the twentieth century, it is likely that not one of them would nominate John von Neumann.
  Few would even recognize his name.
  Despite his obscurity outside the communities of mathematicians and computer theorists, his thoughts had an incalculable impact on human destiny.
  He died in 1957, but the fate of the human race still depends on how we and our descendants decide to use the technologies von Neumann's extraordinary mind made possible.At the end of his life he was an American, and a power behind the scenes of American scientific policy and foreign policy.
  But that was only the last of several equally distinguished identities in different countries and fields of thought.
  Janos Neumann, known as "Jansci," was a prodigious young chemical engineer turned mathematician and logician in Hungary in the early 1920s.
  Johann von Neumann was one of the elite quantum physics revolutionaries in Gottingen, Germany, in the late twenties.
  And from 1933 until his death, he was John von Neumann of Princeton, New Jersey; Los Alamos, New Mexico; and Washington, D.C., known to professors and Presidents as "Johnny."
  Ada and Babbage could only dream of the day their device could be put to work.
