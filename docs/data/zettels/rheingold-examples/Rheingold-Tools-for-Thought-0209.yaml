  The value to society of obsessively converting sophisticated computers into toys and games has been a matter of extended debate.
  Nobody would deny that hackers love fantasy.
  That these fantasies can be fascinating to nonhackers as well has been an inside secret for years, ever since the hack known as "Dwarf Hall of Mists, XYZZY and the Infamous Repository," created by Will Crowther and Don Woods, now more commonly known as "Adventure," surfaced at MAC and SAIL.
  After they introduce you to ELIZA, "Adventure" is what hackers show you when you ask them why they are addicted to computing.
  They hit a few keys, sit you down in front of a monitor and a keyboard, and come back in a few hours to forcibly unplug you.
  Even in this age of more dazzling computer-generated effects, the sheer temptation to explore the computer-stored fantasy remains strong.
  After you are told you can give simple instructions like "drop sword," "go up," "cross bridge," the following words, still famous at every computer center, appear on the screen: "You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.
  Around you is a forest.
  A small stream flows out of the building and down a gully .
  Without warning, and without any high-resolution graphics or sound effects, you are drawn into Colossal Cave, where a labyrinth of chambers containing treasure, dwarfs, magic, strategy and dangers awaits your command.
