  Sysops are like benevolent dictators.
  They can weed you out of the community memory if they want, but then again, their computer is the one that provides a message-mediation system to anyone who wants to drop in, electronically speaking.
  Clyde Ghost Monster was an anarchist sysop, who preferred the rule of wit.
  Clyde Ghost Monster, I was to learn weeks later, was also a sixteen-year-old girl.
  Tater Tot was a seventeen-year-old boy who went to her high school.
  They had no idea who Ivan Idea was.
  Clyde told me that if I wanted to find out about new kinds of communities, I ought to call a conference-tree bulletin board in Santa Cruz, California, and read the opening message for "ORIGINS."
  The conference tree is a bulletin-board-based medium that seems particularly well suited to wildly heterogeneous experiments in communitarian communication.
  The idea behind a conference tree is that you can call in and read from or write to a variety of conferences, each one consisting of a constantly branching list of messages and submessages.
  The name of the message conveys something of what it is all about, and all the variations of opinion from rabid enthusiasm to utter contempt can be expressed in submessages and submessages of submessages.
