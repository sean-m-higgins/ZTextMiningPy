note: |
  At the age of sixteen, his family's precarious financial situation obliged Boole to secure modest employment as a schoolteacher.
  Faced with the task of teaching his students something about mathematics, and by now thoroughly Lincolnesque in his self-educating skills, Boole set out to learn mathematics.
  He soon learned that it was the most cost-effective intellectual endeavor for a man of his means, requiring no laboratory equipment and a fairly small number of basic books.
  At seventeen he experienced the inspiration that was to result in his later work, but he had much to learn about both mathematics and logic before he was capable of presenting his discovery to the world.
  At the age of twenty he discovered something that the greatest mathematicians of his time had missed--an algebraic theory of invariance that was to become an indispensable tool for Einstein when he formulated the theory of relativity.
  In 1849, after his long years as an elementary-school teacher, Boole's mathematical publications brought him an appointment as professor of mathematics at Queen's College, Cork, Ireland.
  Five years later, he published An investigation of the laws of thought, on which are founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities.
  Formal logic had been around since the time of the Greeks, most widely known in the syllogistic form perfected by Aristotle, the simplified version of which most people learn no more than: "All men are mortal.
  Socrates is a man.
  Therefore Socrates is mortal."
