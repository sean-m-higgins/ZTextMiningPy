  While many of his colleagues opt for sandals, down jackets, techno-hippie ponytails, blue jeans, and rumpled cords with or without bicycle clips, Taylor is likely to be found in a pressed tweed jacket and unrumpled slacks.
  His blond hair is casual but neat.
  When he's trying to see if you are following his line of thought, he tilts his forehead in your direction and targets you with pale blue eyes over what would pass for granny glasses if his shirt were denim instead of oxford cotton.
  He smiles often, sometimes as a form of punctuation.
  A trace of Texas drifts into his voice at times.
  It is Taylor's belief that the idea of personal computing was a direct outgrowth of what Licklider started in the early 1960s with time-sharing research.
  Time-sharing, like the first high-level languages, was a watershed for computer science and for the augmentation approach.
  It also created a new subcommunity within the computation world, a community of interests that cut across the boundaries of military, scientific, academic, and business computing.
  It was a relatively small subculture within the larger community of computer scientists and computer systems builders.
  They were bonded by a common desire for a certain kind of computer they wanted for their own use, and by a decade of common experiences as a part of the ARPA research effort to build the kind of computers they were then using.
