  It was an important first try at "reaching through" the toolkit to engage in communication with another human user of the system.
  It was a theoretical precursor to the "electronic mail" medium that was to evolve when the ARPA network became operational in the early 1970s.
  When ARPAnet came along, connecting many computers in different locations into a shared computational "space," it wasn't such a shocking new medium to those few ARC pioneers who had been working on a smaller, localized version for years.
  The journal was designed to bring order to a stream of dialogues, notes, and publications generated in the process of building the system and finding out how to work it.
  Besides serving as an electronic logbook that would be useful to human factors specialists and systems programmers, the journal was meant to be a medium for a formal dialogue among users that would serve the same purpose as today's traditional libraries and professional journals -- but would do so in such an amplified manner that it would become a uniquely powerful method of transmitting knowledge.
  For example, scientific journals in every field follow a form in which a paper describing research results is refereed, then published, after which subsequent papers can cite the previous paper.
  The record in any field of scientific knowledge -- and the forum in which the significance of findings is debated -- consists of a growing list of journal citations and accompanying text.
  It takes time for new innovation and comments to circulate, and it takes a relatively long time for individuals to thread their way through a branching history of citations.
  In the NLS version, it is very easy to jump directly and quickly from any article to the text of cited articles and back -- reducing to seconds or minutes procedures that would take hours or months in even the most efficient library/journal system.
  Publication and distribution are radically changed by a computerized system, since it is so easy to automatically notify everybody on a certain kind of reading list material matching their interest profile is now available.
