  Coding refers to "a system of signals used to represent letters or numbers in transmitting messages"; storing means holding these signals until they're needed.
  Noise is a disturbance that obscures or affects the quality of a signal (or message) during transmission.
  It turns out that coding and storing happen to be central problems in the logical design of computing machines and the creation of software.
  The basic scientific work that resulted in information theory did not originate from any investigation of computation, however, but from an analysis of communication.
  Claude Shannon, several years younger than Turing, working about a year after the British logician's discoveries in metamathematics, did another nifty little bit of graduate work that tied together theory and engineering, philosophy, and machinery.Chapter Six: Inside Information His unicycle skills notwithstanding, Claude Shannon has been more flamboyant but no less brilliant than his elder colleagues.
  Rather than advertising his own genius like Wiener, or blitzing the world of science with salvo after salvo of landmark findings like von Neumann, Claude Shannon has published unprolifically, and he spends more time attempting to diminish rather than embellish the mythology that grew up around his infrequent but monumental contributions.
  A modest man, perhaps, but hardly a timid one, when Shannon has something to publish, it usually changes the world.Claude Shannon was a bona fide prodigy, twenty-two years old when he published (in 1937) the famous MIT master's thesis that linked electrical circuitry to logical formalisms.
  He was the peer of pioneers like Turing, Wiener, and von Neumann, the teacher of the first generation of artificial intelligence explorers like John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky, and the mentor of Ivan Sutherland, who has been one of the most important contemporary infonaut-architects.
  When Shannon's papers establishing information theory were published in 1948, he was thirty-two.
  The impact on science of this man's career was incalculable for these two contributions alone, but he also wrote a pioneering article on the artificial intelligence question of game-playing machines, published in 1950.
