  But the idea people in universities and corporate laboratories, the research and development pioneers who made the technology possible, were not the only contemporaries whom Nelson watched and applauded in the mid 1970s as they streaked past him on their way to somewhere.
  As had happened so often before, some unknown young people appeared from an unexpected quarter to create a new way to use the formerly esoteric machinery.
  The legend is firmly established by now, and Ted was the first to chronicle it, in The Home Computer Revolution.
  By the mid-1970s the state of integrated circuitry had reached such a high degree of miniaturization that it was possible to make electronic components thousands of times more complicated than ENIAC -- except these machines didn't heat a warehouse to 120 degrees.
  In fact, they tended to get lost if you dropped them on the rug.
  In 1971, a team at Intel Corporation developed the special integrated circuits that contained all the components needed to make a fairly powerful von Neumann-type computer -- the 4004, followed by the 8008 "computer-on-a-chip."
  At the time it was invented, nobody realized that the microprocessor, one of thousands of electronic components churned out every year, would become a household word.
  At that point, probably no more than a few score highly placed or technically fanatic people in the world had computers in their homes for their personal use.
  IBM and DEC didn't exactly see the invention of the microprocessor chip as the signal to start producing consumer computers.
  In 1974, a fellow in New Mexico named Ed Roberts, president of a company called Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS), happened upon the 8008 chip and got a notion.
