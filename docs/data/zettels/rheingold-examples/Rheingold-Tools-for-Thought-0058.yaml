note: |
  This code can be interpreted by a machine, a machine that automatically manipulates the tokens, given a list of instructions and a starting configuration.
  When the machine stops, you read the tape and you get the output of the program.
  In this case, you put the number you want to double in the starting configuration, and then let the machine metaphorically clank away one square at a time, erasing and writing Os or Xs.
  When the machine stops, you count the Xs in the final tape configuration.
  The list of instructions is what turns the universal Turing machine into the doubling machine.
  Mechanically, there is no difference between the two machines.
  The particular instructions described by the code are what the universal Turing machine operates upon.
  If you can describe, in similarly codable instructions, a machine for tripling, or extracting square roots, or performing differential equations, then your basic, dumb old universal Turing machine can imitate your tripling machine or square root machine.
  That ability to imitate other machines is what led to computers.
  The numbers (or Xs and Os) on the tape aren't that important.
