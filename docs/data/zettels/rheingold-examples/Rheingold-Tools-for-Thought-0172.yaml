note: |
  The crude interaction between the operator and the PDP-1 might be just the beginning of a powerful new kind of human-computer partnership.
  A new kind of computer would have to evolve before this higher level of human-machine interaction could be possible.
  The way the machine was operated by people would have to change, and the machine itself would have to become much faster and more powerful.
  Although he was still a novice in digital computer design, Licklider was familiar with vacuum tube circuitry and enough of an expert in the hybrid discipline of "human factors engineering" to recognize that the mechanical assistant he wanted would need capabilities that would be possible only with the ultrafast computers he foresaw in the near future.
  When he began applying the methods he had been using in human factors research to the informational and communication activities of technical thinkers like himself, Licklider found himself drawn to the idea of a kind of computation that was more dynamic, more of a dialogue , more of an aid in formulating as well as plotting models.
  Licklider set forth in 1960 the specifications for a new species of computer and a new mode of thinking to be used when operating them, a specification that is still not fully realized, a quarter of a century later: The information processing equipment, for its part, will convert hypotheses into testable models and then test the models against data (which the human operator may designate roughly and identify as relevant when the computer presents them for his approval).
  The equipment will answer questions.
  It will simulate the mechanisms and models, carry out procedures, and display the results to the operator.
  It will transform data, plot graphs, ("cutting the cake" in whatever way the human operator specifies, or in several alternative ways if the human operator is not sure what he wants).
  The equipment will interpolate, extrapolate, and transform.
