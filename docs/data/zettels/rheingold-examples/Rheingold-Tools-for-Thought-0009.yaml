note: |
  Alan Turing solved one of the most crucial mathematical problems of the modern era at the age of twenty-four, creating the theoretical basis for computation in the process.
  Then he became the top code-breaker in the world--when he wasn't bicycling around wearing a gas mask or running twenty miles with an alarm clock tied around his waist.
  If it hadn't been for the success of Turing's top-secret wartime mission, the Allies might have lost World War II.
  After the war, he created the field of artificial intelligence and laid down the foundations of the art and science of programming.
  He was notoriously disheveled, socially withdrawn, sometimes loud and abrasive, and even his friends thought that he carried nonconformity to weird extremes.
  At the age of forty-two, he committed suicide, hounded cruelly by the same government he helped save.
  John von Neumann spoke five languages and knew dirty limericks in all of them.
  His colleagues, famous thinkers in their own right, all agreed that the operations of Johnny's mind were too deep and far too fast to be entirely human.
  He was one of history's most brilliant physicists, logicians, and mathematicians, as well as the software genius who invented the first electronic digital computer.
  John von Neumann was the center of the group who created the "stored program" concept that made truly powerful computers possible, and he specified a template that is still used to design almost all computers--the "von Neumann architecture."
