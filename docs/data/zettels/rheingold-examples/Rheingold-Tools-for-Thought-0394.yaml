  I have never known anyone who hated school as much as I did, although my assumption is that other dropouts do."
  Despite his repeated clashes with educational authorities, Ted Nelson managed to establish himself as an "extreme loony on campus" at Swarthmore , in the late 1950s, a place and an era where extreme loonies were rather more rare than they became a decade later.
  He also managed to graduate with an academic record good enough to give him his choice of graduate schools.
  He decided on Harvard, an institution known to tolerate intellectual arrogance as long as it was accompanied by near-genius originality.
  In the fall of 1960, during his second year of graduate school, Ted Nelson found out about computers, and not a moment too soon.
  He was drowning in his own information, carrying around an already monumental collection of barely collated notes about his abundant dreams and schemes.
  He found out about Vannevar Bush's paper and embraced the idea that he could use a computer to keep track of his own prodigious stream of thoughts and sketches.
  Ted was disappointed to discover that there were no computers equipped or programmed to perform such a service.
  Down the road at MIT, the first time-sharing computers were only beginning to be built.
  But Ted needed a storage and retrieval system to keep track of his notes, and it seemed like such an obvious way to use computers as aids to creative thought that he set out to create such a program himself.
