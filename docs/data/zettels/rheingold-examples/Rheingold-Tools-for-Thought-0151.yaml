  The game is a mundane version of "twenty questions."
  In the case of the English alphabet, it turns out to be a game of "five questions."
  Player number one thinks of a letter of the alphabet.
  Player number two tries to guess the letter, using only questions like "is it earlier than L in the alphabetical sequence?"
  It is a strictly yes-or-no game, in which only one of two possible answers applies at every move.
  Shannon pointed out that it takes a maximum of five questions to locate any of the thirty symbols necessary for making English sentences.
  If the sequence of yes or no decisions needed to specify the correct letter is converted into a sequence of zeroes and ones or a sequence of on and off impulses, or any other kind of binary symbol, you have a code for communicating the alphabet -- which is, in fact, the basis of the code used for transmitting teletypewriter messages.
  This game can be visualized as a tree structure, where each letter is the only leaf on a branch that branches off a branch that eventually branches off a trunk.
  Or it can be seen as a garden of forking paths, where each path is a sequence of one-way-or-the-other decisions, and the location of any endpoint can be coded by specifying the sequence of decisions along the path.
  It is also a good way to locate an address in a computer's memory or to encode an instruction to be placed in that location.
