  One of the historical coincidences was the position of Vannevar Bush as the leader of war-related research.
  In his role as a research administrator, Bush knew that antiaircraft technology was one of his top priorities.
  As a scientist, MIT researcher, and friend of Norbert Wiener's, Bush was also concerned with the task of building high-speed mechanical calculators.
  The allies' two most pressing problems in the early years of World War II were the devastating U-boat war in the North Atlantic and the equally devastating Luftwaffe attacks on Britain.
  Turing's secret solution to the naval Enigma machine was responsible, in large part, for solving the U-boat problem.
  But where Turing's problem was one of cryptanalysis, of mathematically retrieving the meaning from a garbled message, the Luftwaffe problem was one of predicting the future: How can you shoot at a plane that is going as fast as your bullets?
  Radar made it possible to track the positions of enemy aircraft, but there was no way to translate the radar-provided information into a ballistic equation quickly enough to do any good.
  And attacking airplanes had a disconcerting habit of taking evasive action.
  Vannevar Bush was well acquainted with the calculation problem when Bell Laboratories came to him with an interesting idea for an electrically operated aiming device.
  That is where the young engineer's dream came in.
