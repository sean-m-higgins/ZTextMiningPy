  The interface hardware and software are what computer people call the "front end" of the system.
  The back end is what the system needs in the way of smarts so that outcomes end up being dramatically pleasurable.
  Right now, you can wander around in an adventure game and gather treasure and kill monsters and finish by winning or being killed.
  There isn't a sense of unfolding drama.
  In order for the front end of an adventure game to convey that sense of direct, first-person drama, it would have to be based on a very sophisticated back end.
  But you could take the same world with the same characters and the same elements and add this sense of drama, and come out with something that would be more like experiencing a drama at first hand.
  The system has to have a good enough model of me, and memory of how I have acted in the past, to make good guesses about how I'm likely to act in the future.
  Let's look down the road ten years.
  Say we really get the system working and we know how to synthesize dramatic outcomes and orchestrate sound tracks and images and give the person who uses the system a way to affect these representations.
  What if the world, instead of planet X or Shakespeare's Denmark, is the world of whales or the worlds of chemical reactions?
