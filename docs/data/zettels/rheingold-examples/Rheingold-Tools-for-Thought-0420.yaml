note: |
  The human universals of the ordinary, everyday moment, and the personal relationship, form the basis for this training.
  ORIGINS has no leaders, no official existence, nothing for sale.
  Because it started in an open computer conference, no one knows who all the creators are.
  This movement has just begun.
  The brochure mentioned above recommends seven practices (Leverage a favor, Ask for help and get it, Use charisma, Finish a job, Use magic, Observe yourself, Share Grace), but these suggestions are only starters.
  The idea is to continually develop new training/action methods, as a community project, then discuss and share them through whatever communications media are available.
  This movement will never be finished, because it seeks a community of permanent innovation.
  The hope is to build something which can make a better world.
  The first step is to make your own life better.
  For a more detailed overview of ORIGINS, get the brochure from the address above.
