  That's a powerful idea that we can see at work right now in the best of contemporary educational software."
  She offered the example of a game in which the players experience the fantasy of being cadets on a starship.
  Each cadet would be responsible for running part of the ship.
  The players can choose whether they want to specialize in navigation or propulsion or life support or computer systems.
  In real time, they run their parts of the ship.
  Then something goes wrong -- the life-support systems are threatened, the reactor is malfunctioning.
  Or something interesting occurs -- the exobiologists have spotted a planet to investigate.
  The players have to find out what to do and how to do it.
  In the first person.
  I accept it too.
