  Is Ted Nelson any crazier than Alan Turing?
  Did Gutenberg think about the effects of public libraries?
  Hints to the shape of the emerging order can be gleaned from the uses people are beginning to think up for computers and networks.
  But it is a bit like watching the old films of flying machines of the early twentieth century, the kind that get a lot of laughs whenever they are shown to modern audiences because some of the spiral-winged or twelve-winged jobs look so ridiculous from the perspective of the jet age.
  Yet everyone can see how very close the spiral-winged contraption had come close to the principle of the helicopter.
  The dispersal of powerful computer technology to large segments of the world's population, and the phasing-in of the comprehensive information-processing global nervous system that seems to be abuilding, are already propelling us toward a social transformation that we know very little about, except that it will be far different from previous transformations because the tool that will trigger the change is so different from previous tools.
  Not all of those who have tried to predict the course of this transformation have been so optimistic as Licklider or Nelson.
  Joseph Weizenbaum, in particular, has voiced his fear of the danger of mistaking computers for human minds or treating human beings as machines.
  Weizenbaum's argument, in part, points out that the aspect of human nature that was externalized by the invention and evolution of computers was precisely the most machine-like aspect.
  The machines that embody this aspect can do some very impressive things that humans cannot do, and at present can do very little of the more sophisticated intellectual feats humans can accomplish.
