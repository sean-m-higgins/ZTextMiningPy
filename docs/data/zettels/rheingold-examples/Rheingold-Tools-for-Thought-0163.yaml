  Licklider noted every task he did during the day and kept track of each one.
  He didn't know it then, but that unofficial experiment prepared the way for the invention of interactive computing -- the technology that bridged yesteryear's number crunchers and tomorrow's mind amplifiers.Licklider's research specialty was psychoacoustics.
  During World War II, he had explored ways electronics could be applied to understanding human communications.
  Specifically, he wanted to learn how the human ear and brain are able to convert atmospheric vibrations into the perception of distinct sounds.
  After the war, MIT was the center of a number of different attempts to use electronic mechanisms to model parts of the nervous system -- a movement in biology and psychology as well as engineering that was inspired by the work of Wiener and others in the interdisciplinary field of cybernetics.
  Licklider was one of the researchers attracted to this paradigm, not strictly out of the desire to build a new kind of machine, but out of the need for new ways to simulate the activities of the human brain.
  This need, inspired by cybernetics, was extended simultaneously into engineering and physiology.
  Computers were the last thing on Licklider's mind -- until his theoretical models of human perceptual mechanisms got out of hand.
  By the late 1950s, Licklider was trying to build mathematical and electronic models of the mechanisms the brain uses to process the perception of sounds.
  Part of the excitement generated during the early days of cybernetic research came from the prospect of studying mechanical models of living organisms to help create theoretical models of the way those organisms function, and vice-versa.
