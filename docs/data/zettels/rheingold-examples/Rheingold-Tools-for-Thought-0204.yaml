  His creation of a program that gave the illusion of a wise, all-knowing, computerized psychiatrist -- and his shock at seeing how willingly even his computer-sophisticated colleagues were taken in by the illusion -- triggered Weizenbaum's dissension.
  Weizenbaum started out at MIT with what he thought would be an abstract interest in programs that used simple programming tricks to answer questions posed in English.
  He put together a working version that the hackers had fun with, and which seemed to be a step, albeit a very primitive first step, toward a genuine language-understanding program.
  The hackers enjoyed the pretense that they were "conversing" with a computer, even though they knew that the program was parsing very simple sentences with no real underlying understanding of their meaning.
  While he was working on a more elaborate question-answering program, with greater sentence-parsing capabilities than his first version, Weizenbaum met a psychiatrist from Stanford named Kenneth Colby, who was interested in using computers to model mental states and mental disorders in order to find clues to more effective forms of psychotherapy.
  Colby helped Weizenbaum create a special-case version of ELIZA, known as DOCTOR.
  In the introduction of his 1976 book, Weizenbaum described how this most successful and disturbing version of ELIZA came into being, and conveyed a little of the flavor of the "ELIZA effect": The work was done in the period 1964-1966, and it was reported in the computer-science literature in January 1966 and August 1967.
  To summarize it briefly, I composed a computer program with which one could "converse" in English.
  The human conversationalist partner would type his portion of the conversation on a typewriter connected to a computer, and the computer, under control of my program, would analyze the message that had been transmitted to it, compose a response to it in English, and cause the response to be typed on the computer's typewriter.
  I chose the name ELIZA for the language analysis program because, like the Eliza of Pygmalion fame, it could be taught to "speak" increasingly well.
