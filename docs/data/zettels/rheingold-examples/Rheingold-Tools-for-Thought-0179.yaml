note: |
  Something had to be done to streamline the process of technological progress in fields vital to the national security.
  One answer was NASA, which grew from a tiny sub-agency to a bureaucratic, scientific, and engineering force of its own.
  And the Defense Department created the Advanced Research Projects Agency, ARPA.
  ARPA's mandate was to find and fund bold projects that had a chance of advancing America's defense-related technologies by orders of magnitude -- bypassing the peer review process by putting research administrators in direct contact with researchers.
  Because of their involvement with previous air defense projects, a few of Licklider's friends from Lincoln, like Wesley Clark, were involved in the changeover to the fast-moving, forward-thinking, well funded, results-oriented ARPA way of doing things.
  Clark designed the TX-0 and TX-2 computers at MIT and Lincoln.
  The first of these machines became famous as the favorite tool of the "hackers" in "building 26," who later became the legendary core of Project MAC.
  The second machine was designed expressly for advanced graphic display research.
  Graphic displays were esoteric devices in 1960, known only to certain laboratories and defense facilities.
  Aside from the PDP-1, almost every computer displayed information via a teletype machine.
