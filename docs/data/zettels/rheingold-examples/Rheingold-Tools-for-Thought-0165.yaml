  Astonishing as it must have seemed to any self-respecting scientist like himself, his observations revealed that about 85% of his "thinking" time was actually spent "getting into a position to think, to make a decision, to learn something I needed to know.
  Much more time went into finding or obtaining information than into digesting it."
  Like almost any other experimentalist, he couldn't begin to make sense of psychoacoustic data until he could see it translated into the form of graphs.
  Plotting the graphs took days.
  Even teaching his assistants how to plot graphs took hours.
  As soon as the graphs were finished and he was able to look at them, the relationships he was seeking became immediately obvious.
  It was grossly inefficient and tedious to spend days plotting graphs that took seconds to interpret.
  While he had always thought of interpretation and evaluation as his most important function as a scientist, Licklider's analysis of his research behavior showed that most of his tasks were clerical or mechanical: "searching, calculating, plotting, determining the logical or dynamic consequences of a set of assumptions or hypotheses, preparing the way for a decision or an insight.
  Moreover, my choices of what to attempt or not to attempt were determined to an embarrassingly great extent by considerations of clerical feasibility, not intellectual capacity."
  The conclusion he reached, while it doesn't sound so radical today, was shocking when it occurred to him in 1957.
