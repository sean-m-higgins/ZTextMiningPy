  David thinks that "for my peculiar cognitive style, programming was a perfect preparation for psychedelics, because it allowed me to model a little piece of my personality in the machine, and interact with it.
  The older hackers would tell me 'never mind what the main program does, we want you to write a program that moves a chess piece on a chessboard,' so I wrote a small, gemlike part of the utility package that went into one of the chess programs.
  The next time I found myself in one of those gemlike structures on my first acid trip."
  The small "gemlike structures" that David created were incorporated into early versions of Greenblatt's MacHack, the program that eventually became an emblem of the hackers' sovereignty within the AI community when MacHack met Dreyfus in 1967.
  It all started when Hubert Dreyfus had the temerity to question not only the chances of success but the very legitimacy of AI research.
  The entire field of artificial intelligence had been challenged as a fraud, and very serious efforts that went beyond the usual acrimony of academic debate were being made to cut off funding for the foolishness Minsky et al.
  The Dreyfus affair began in the summer of 1965, when Hubert Dreyfus -- a philosopher, not a computer scientist -- spent a few months at the Rand Corporation.
  The paper that Dreyfus wrote at the end of that summer, entitled "Alchemy and Artificial Intelligence," was informally circulated as a Rand report.
  Dreyfus thought that AI was a crock.
  He specifically attacked some of the claims AI enthusiasts had made about the future of their field.
