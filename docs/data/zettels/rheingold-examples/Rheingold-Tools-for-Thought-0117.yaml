  Norbert's father, a Harvard professor who was a colorful character in his own right, had definite opinions about education, and publicly declared his intention to mold his young son's mind.
  Norbert was to become a lovingly but systematically engineered genius.

  He is the father of four children, ranging in age from four to sixteen; and he has the courage of his convictions in making them the subject of an educational experiment.
  The results have .
  This lad, at eleven, entered Tufts College, form which he graduated in 1909, when he was only fourteen years old.
  He then entered Harvard Graduate School.
  Norbert completed his examinations and his doctoral dissertation in mathematical logic when he was eighteen, then studied with Bertrand Russell in Cambridge and David Hilbert in Gttingen, where he later crossed paths with von Neumann, nine years his junior, also a student of Hilbert's, and a world renowned authority in several of Wiener's fields of interest.
  One of the most immediate differences between the two prodigies, even this early in their careers, was the pronounced contrast between their personalities.
  Rare was the teacher or student who failed to be charmed by von Neumann, who went out of his way to assure fellow humans that he was just as mortal as everyone else.
