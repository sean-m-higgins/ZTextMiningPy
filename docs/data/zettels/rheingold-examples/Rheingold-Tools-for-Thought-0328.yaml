note: |
  A library is a passive repository of cultural treasures.
  You have to go in and dig out your own meanings.
  A Dynabook would combine the addictive allure of a good video game with the cultural resources of a library and a museum, with the expressive power of an animated fingerpaint set and a synthesized orchestra.
  Most importantly, it would actively find the knowledge appropriate for the task of the moment, communicated in the form and language best suited to each individual who used it.
  The intelligence of such devices -- the reason that software breakthroughs in artificial intelligence research would someday have to intersect with the evolution of personal computers -- would influence their ability to bring resources to the person who needs them.
  When the machines grow smart enough to communicate with eight-year-olds, then the question will shift from how to build a computer that people can easily use to what we all do with that kind of power.
  What if libraries were able to find out what most interests you and what you most need to know, and showed you how to find what you wanted?
  What if you could say to the library: "I wonder what it would be like to live in the Baghdad of the Caliphate?"
  Do you like Van Gogh?
  How about a simulation of the fields outside his house?
