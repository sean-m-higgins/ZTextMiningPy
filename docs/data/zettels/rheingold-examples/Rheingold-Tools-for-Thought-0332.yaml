  In the conclusion of his article, Kay cautions against the presumptions of present-day minds about what the minds of future generations may or may not choose to do with the instruments past generations worked to create: A popular misconception about computers is that they are logical.
  Forthright is a better term.
  Since computers can contain arbitrary descriptions, any conceivable collection of rules, consistent or not, can be carried out.
  Moreover, computers' use of symbols, like the use of symbols in language and mathematics, is sufficiently disconnected from the real world to enable them to create splendid nonsense.
  Although the hardware of the computer is subject to natural laws (electrons can move through circuits only in certain physically defined ways), the range of simulations the computer can perform is bounded only by the limits of human imagination.
  In a computer, spacecraft can be made to travel faster than the speed of light, to time travel in reverse.
  It may seem almost sinful to discuss the simulation of nonsense, but only if we want to believe that what we know is correct and complete.
  History has not been kind to those who subscribe to this view.
  It is just this realm of apparent nonsense that must be kept open for the developing minds of the future.
  Although the personal computer can be guided in any direction we choose, the real sin would be to make it act like a machine!
