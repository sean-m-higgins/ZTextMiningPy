  His name was D. B. Parkinson, and he was working with a group of Bell engineers on an automatic level recorder for making more accurate measurements of telephone transmissions -- a "control potentiometer," they called it.
  In the spring of 1940, Parkinson had the following dream: I found myself in a gun pit or revetment with an anti-aircraft gun crew.
  There was a gun there which looked to me -- I had never had any close association with anti-aircraft guns, but possessed some general information on artillery -- like a 3 inch.
  It was firing occasionally, and the impressive thing was that every shot brought down an airplane!
  After three or four shots one of the men in the crew smiled at me and beckoned me to come closer to the gun.
  When I drew near he pointed to the exposed end of the left trunnion.
  Mounted there was the control potentiometer of my level recorder!
  There was no mistaking it -- it was the identical item.
  The electrical device, as it happened, was a good start on an automatic aiming mechanism.
  But very serious theoretical and mathematical problems, having to do with the way the control device sent and received instructions, cropped up when they tried to construct such a mechanism.
