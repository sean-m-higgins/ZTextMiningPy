  Engelbart started designing computer-based problem-solving systems in 1951.
  He hasn't stopped yet.
  The earliest and one of the clearest articulations of the idea that information processing technology could be used to amplify human memory and thinking was the one Doug found that day in 1945, in an article entitled "As We May Think," published toward the end of the war in The Atlantic Monthly.
  The author was the highest-ranking scientific administrator in the U.S. war effort, Vannevar Bush.
  Bush, the son and grandson of Yankee seafarers, was the same mathematician who had constructed analog computers at MIT in the 1930s.
  He was also in charge of over 6000 U.S. scientists during World War II, as director of the Office of Research and Development.
  His two most important goals were starting the Manhattan project and finding a means to stop German bombing, goals that both directly hastened the invention of computing machinery.
  Ironically, Bush didn't mention the potential of the early computers as information-handling devices when he wrote his article.
  But he did present an idea that was to bear fruit many years later -- a description of a science-fiction-like general-purpose tool to help us keep track of what we know.
  Looking toward the postwar world, Bush foresaw that recent breakthroughs in science and technology were going to create problems of their own.
