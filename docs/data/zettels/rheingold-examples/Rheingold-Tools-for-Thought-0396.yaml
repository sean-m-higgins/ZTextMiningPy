  They both wanted the freedom to steer their thought paths in new ways.
  And Ted especially desired the prerogative of changing his mind.
  He wanted the freedom to insert and delete words and move paragraphs around, but he also wanted the computer to remember his decision path.
  One of the specs was for something he called "historical backtrack," in which the computer could quickly show him the various earlier alternative versions of his ever-changing text.
  From a place to store notes to a tool for sculpting text, his term project had now landed him in even more wondrous science-fiction territory, a place where it was possible to think in terms of parallel alternatives.
  Of entire libraries of parallel alternatives, and automated librarians to perform the most tedious of searches in microseconds.
  Why should we abandon any thought at all?
  Why not just store every variation on everything and let the computer take care of sifting through it when we want to view something?
  Ted Nelson was hooked, and desperately wanted to become a "computer person," but came up against the still-prevalent notion that computers are "mathematical."
  Never one to be accused of excessive modesty regarding his intellectual powers, Nelson admits that he was "a mathematical incompetent."
