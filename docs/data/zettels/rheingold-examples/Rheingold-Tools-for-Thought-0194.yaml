  Their values were entirely their own: academic or commercial success was too trivial to be considered a driving motivation; the opportunity to work with like-minded colleagues on state-of-the-art equipment was paramount.
  They had their own culture, their own ethic, even their own dialect.
  The eighteen-year-old MIT dropouts David Rodman wanted to emulate were distinguished from the hippies and radicals they superficially resembled because they all happened to have a talent that was particularly valued in those days, and still is -- the ability to write code that makes computers useful to nonprogrammers.
  While all their former classmates were on to their doctorates and assistant professorships and corporate research laboratories, the misfits suddenly found their conventionally successful peers, at a job where they weren't relegated to working out a payroll system or an airline reservation service.
  The hackers knew, even if nobody else did, that they -- and not IBM, or even their straighter "FORTRAN type" colleagues in computer science -- were the test pilots of the computational frontier, pushing the limits of what could be done with each fresh generation of hardware.
  Their mandate was to dream up new things for computers to do, and in the process what they did was invent a whole new computer system and computer-oriented society, a technology and social order in which their own little fraternity of ex-outsiders, and not the conventional computer types, were privileged to know the inner mysteries.
  When the rest of the world caught up with them, they knew they would be on to something even more mysterious to the outsider and more exciting to the hacker.
  None of them would deny the charges of addiction.
  Some of the same people who were in that room when David walked in, almost a quarter of a century ago, are still sitting in front of a computer terminal, somewhere on the upper floors of 545 Technology Square.
  Spacewar Their superiors were smart enough to know that the best of the hackers would come up with amazing things if they were left to their own devices.
