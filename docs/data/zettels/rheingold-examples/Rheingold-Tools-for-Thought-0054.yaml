note: |
  In order to play the game (run the program) specified by the list of instructions, one more thing must be provided: a starting tape configuration.
  For our example, let us consider a tape with two Xs on it, bounded on both sides by an infinite string of Os.
  The changing states of a single tape are depicted here as a series of tape segments, one above the other.
  The active square for each denoted by a capital X or O.
  When the machine is started it will try to execute the first available instruction, instruction #1.
  The following series of actions will then occur: Instruction Tape What the Machine Does #1 ...ooXxooooooo... One (of two) Xs is erased.
  Tape is scanned to the #3 ...oooxOoooooo... right.
  This X is erased.#3 ...ooooOxxoooo... Scanner moves to the right #4 ...oooooXxoooo... of the two Xs that were #4 ...oooooxXoooo... written earlier.
  The machine stops because there is no instruction for #7 if O is being scanned.
  This game may seem rather mechanical.
