  Would you care to sit in with Louis Armstrong or Wolfgang Mozart?
  What would it do to the world if we could all see how everybody else lived and share in their cultures?
  If the first effect of the coming metamedium was likely to be the creation of a literate population who shared a new freedom to use symbols and to choose how to view information, then the second effect lay in the power that would be unique to this medium -- the power of simulation.
  Simulation is the power to see what you imagine, to create worlds that obey your command.
  The computer can build instant sensory representations.
  The user/programmer explores a universe that reacts, in which the degree of the user's power depends upon and grows with one's understanding of the way the worlds work.
  The power of simulation to empower the imagination and give form to whatever can be clearly discerned in the mind's eye is what makes this kind of device a "fantasy amplifier."
  Although there are several homilies that are entitled to be called "Kay's First Law," the statement that he most often calls "Kay's Second Law" is: "Any time you build a fantasy amplifier, you have a winner."
  His reasoning is that game playing and fantasizing are metaphors for the kind of skill people need to get around in the world.
  But our illusion is so complex, so much of the world we experience appears to be beyond our control, and the operating manual is so difficult to find, that we all tend to get locked into the way our families, societies, and cultures see the world.
