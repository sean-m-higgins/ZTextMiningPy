note: |
  Even one of his few intimate friends described his speech as "a shrill stammer and crowing laugh which told upon the nerves even of his friends."
  He never quite got the hang of automobiles, which was probably safer, considering the way Turing's mind wandered far away from the realities of the roadway.
  He preferred the battered bicycle of the Cambridge don.
  The bicycle and his habit of running twenty or thirty miles to attend a meeting were the objects of sundry anecdotes about "the Prof," as Turing was known around Bletchley.
  He was once detained by the local constable for bicycling around in a gas mask, which Truing claimed alleviated his hay fever.
  Turing and his colleagues at Bletchley Park ended up solving the Enigma enigma by devising a series of machines known as "bombes," "the Robinsons," and a culminating contraption known as "Colossus."
  Their purpose?
  To imitate "Enigma," of course!
  The Bletchley Park devices were by no means universal machines by Turing's 1936 definition, but they did use important aspects of Turing's ideas.
  Using high-speed devices for feeding instructions encoded on paper tapes, and electrical circuitry for performing simple but tedious logical operations upon coded messages, the decoding machines began operating in 1943.
