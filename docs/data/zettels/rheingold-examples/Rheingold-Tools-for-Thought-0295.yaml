  Now that truly capable computing machinery was becoming available, it was becoming more widely known that the commercially successful programs of the future would be those that succeeded in bringing the power of the computer out to the person who needs to use it.
  The "rule of two" is, incredibly, still in effect, promising even more powerful and less expensive computer hardware in the late 1980s.
  In 1984, Bob Taylor, now with Digital Equipment Corporation, started doing what he does best -- assembling a computer systems research team for a final assault on the objective.
  Some of the key members of his team were graduate students when ARPA funded time-sharing, and had been involved in the ARC and PARC eras.
  The latest arena for their ongoing effort to bootstrap interactive computation technology to the threshold of truly powerful personal computing was named "Systems Research Center" -- or SRC, pronounced "circ" ("as in circus").
  Then it will become possible to create the software that can take advantage of the capabilities we've known about for a long time."
  Taylor now believes that three factors will lead to the most astonishing plateau in information processing we've seen yet: first, a new level of systems software will be able to take advantage of computer designs that make each personal workstation into a kind of miniature distributed network, with multiple parallel processors inside working in coordination; second, large scale integration processors will be small and cheap enough to put fast, vast memory into desktop machines; third, and most important, the people who built time-sharing, graphics, networks, personal computers, intelligent user interfaces, and distributed computing are now at the height of their powers, and they have put hundreds of thousands of person-hours into learning how to build new levels of computer technology.
  Advances in network technologies, graphics, programming languages, user interfaces, and cheap, large-scale information storage media mean that the basic capabilities dreamed of by the designers of the first personal computers are likely to become widely available before the turn of the century.
  One hopes that we will be ready to use them wisely.
  It would be a sad irony if we were to end up creating a world too complicated for us to manage alone, and fail to recognize that some of our own inventions could help us deal with our own complexity.Chapter Eleven: The Birth of the Fantasy Amplifier When millions of portable, affordable, imagination amplifiers fall into the hands of eight-year-old children, look for Alan Kay somewhere in the plot.
