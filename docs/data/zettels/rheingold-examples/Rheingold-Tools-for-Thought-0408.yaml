  In some quarters of that community, people like Turoff and Engelbart were trying to learn enough from network communication behavior to help them design new tools for group communications.
  The National Science Foundation, deeply concerned with the problem of establishing a new way for the half-million scientists in this country to communicate with each other, sponsored some of the conferencing research.
  Under NSF sponsorship, Turoff moved to the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), to both study and improve the technology.
  A similar project had already begun in California, at a place called Menlo Park, not far from SRI and PARC, called the Institute for the Future.
  Roy Amara and Jacques Vallee and other staff members at the Institute for the Future worked on a system known as PLANET (for Planning Network, because it was initially directed at planners in government and industry).
  Both Turoff's and the institute's systems began with electronic mail, a shared notebook space for joint compositions, a conference facility for in-line and off-line group communications, and an open-message/bulletin board.
  Turoff and his associates' EMISARI system that had evolved from the Delphi Conference System evolved again into the RIMS (Resource Interruption Monitoring System) which had been used, according to Turoff, by the "Federal Preparedness Agency in every major national commodity shortage and transportation strike since 1971."
  By the time he joined NJIT, Turoff's interest had expanded beyond the development of a communications tool for crisis management: "I think the ultimate possibility of computerized conferencing is to provide a way for human groups to exercise a 'collective intelligence' capability," he noted in 1976.
  In principle, a group, if successful, would exhibit an intelligence higher than any member.
  Over the next decades, attempts to design computerized conferencing structures that allow a group to treat a particular complex problem with a single collective brain may well promise more benefit for mankind than all the artificial intelligence work to date."
