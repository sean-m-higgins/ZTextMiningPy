  Bit-mapping created more than a passive window on the computer's internal processes.
  Just as the computer could tell the human who used it certain facts about whatever it had in its memory, the user was also given the power to change the computer by manipulating the display.
  If users change the form of the visual representations on bit-mapped screens, using keyboard commands, lightpens ( la Sketchpad), or pointing devices like mice ( la Engelbart), they can also change the computer's memory.
  The screen is a representation, but it is also a control panel -- a drawing on a bit-mapped screen can be nothing more than a drawing, but it can also be a kind of command, even a program, to control the computer's operations.
  If, for example, you were to use a mouse to move a video pointer on the screen to touch a visual representation of a file folder or an out basket, and you could call the folder, for example, from the computer's memory and display a document from it on your screen simply by pointing to it, or send the contents of the computer-stored out basket to somebody else's in basket, then a person would be able to accomplish the kind of work done in offices, even if that person knew nothing about computer programming.
  Which, after all, was the potential future market that motivated Xerox management to create PARC and cut their whiz kids loose in the first place.
  Creating new kinds of computer input and output devices to help human pattern recognition mesh with mechanical symbol manipulation is known as "designing the human interface," an art and science that had to be created in the 1970s in the kind of human-computer partnership envisioned by Licklider and Engelbart in the 1960s, which could start to happen by the 1980s.
  Alan Kay's Smalltalk project played a key role in the evolution of the Alto interface, and as such was integral to the eventual company goals in the office automation market.
  But even at the beginning, Kay started bringing children into the project.
  Part of the Smalltalk project's effect on the early days at PARC was inspirational.
