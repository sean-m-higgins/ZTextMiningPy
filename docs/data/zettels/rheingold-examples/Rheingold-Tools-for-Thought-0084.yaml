  Although the matter of assigning credit for the earliest computer hardware is a tricky business, there is no denying von Neumann's central role in the history of software.
  His contributions to the science of computation in the late forties and early fifties were preceded by even earlier theoretical work that led to the notion of computation.
  He was one of the principal participants in both of the lines of thought that converged into the construction of ENIAC -- mathematical logic and ballistics.
  John von Neumann's role in the invention of computation began nearly twenty years before the ENIAC project.
  In the late 1920s, between his major contributions to quantum physics, logic, and game theory, young Johann von Neumann of Gttingen was one of the principal players in the international game of mathematical riddles that started with Boole seventy years prior and led to Turing's invention of the universal machine a decade later.
  The impending collision of philosophy and mathematics that was becoming evident at the end of the nineteenth century made mathematicians extremely uncomfortable.
  Slippery metaphysical concepts associated with human thought might have appealed to minds like Boole's or Turing's.
  But to David Hilbert of Gttingen and others of the early 1900s, such vagueness was a grave danger to the future of an enterprise that intended to reduce all scientific laws to mathematical equations.
  The logical and metamathematical foundations of more "pure" forms of mathematics, Hilbert insisted, could only be stated clearly in terms of numerical problems and precisely defined symbols and rules and operations.
  This was the doctrine of formalism that later spurred Turing to make his astonishing discovery about the capabilities of machines.
