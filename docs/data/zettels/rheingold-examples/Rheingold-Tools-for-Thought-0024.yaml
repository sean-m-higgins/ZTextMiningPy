note: |
  Up to one thousand different 50-digit numbers could be stored for later reference in the memory unit Babbage called the "store."
  To display the result, Babbage designed the first automated typesetter.
  Numbers could be put into the store from the mill or from the punched-card input system Babbage adapted from French weaving machines.
  In addition, cards could be used to enter numbers into the mill and specify the calculations to be performed on the numbers as well.
  By using the cards properly, the mill could be instructed to temporarily place the results in the store, then return the stored numbers to the mill for later procedures.
  The final component of the Analytical Engine was a card-reading device that was, in effect, a control and decision-making unit.
  A working model was eventually built by Babbage's son.
  Babbage himself never lived to see the Analytical Engine.
  Toward the end of his life, a visitor found that Babbage had filled nearly all the rooms of his large house with abandoned models of his engine.
  As soon as it looked as if one means of constructing his device might actually work--Babbage thought of a new and better way of doing it.
