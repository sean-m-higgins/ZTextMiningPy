  He wants programming to become a performing art.
  But long before hackers started thinking about using their computers for intellectual improvisation -- before David Rodman was born, in fact -- a dreamer out in California was designing his own kind of mind amplifier.Chapter Nine: The Loneliness of a Long-Distance Thinker Harry Truman was President and Sputnik was a word that only Russian language experts knew when Doug Engelbart first thought about displaying words and images on radar screens, storing them in computers, and manipulating them with levers and buttons and keyboards.
  For over thirty years, Engelbart has been trying to hasten what he believes will be the biggest step in cultural evolution since the invention of the printing press.
  To hear him tell it today, both the computer establishment and the computer revolutionaries still fail to understand that the art and power of using a computer as a mind amplifier are not in how the amplifier works but in what the amplified minds are able to accomplish.At the end of the summer of 1945, just after the surrender of Japan, Engelbart was a twenty-year-old American naval radar technician, waiting for his ship home from the Philippines.
  One muggy day, he wandered into a Red Cross library that was built up on stilts, like a native hut.
  Vannevar Bush "It was quiet and cool and airy inside, with lots of polished bamboo and books.
  That was where I ran across that article by Vannevar Bush," Engelbart recalls.
  More than three decades later, he still fondly remembers the room where he first encountered the dream that has dominated most of his life.
  At that time, the news of Hiroshima was still fresh and searing.
  He found himself wondering whether the same inventiveness that produced nuclear bombs might be used to prevent such destruction in the future.
