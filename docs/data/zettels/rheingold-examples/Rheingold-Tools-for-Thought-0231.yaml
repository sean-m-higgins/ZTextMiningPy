  Doug kept looking for the right institutional base.
  In October, 1957, the very month of Sputnik, he received an offer from an organization in Menlo Park, "across the creek" from Palo Alto, then known as the Stanford Research Institute.
  They were interested in conducting research into scientific, military, and commercial applications of computers.
  One of the people who interviewed him for the SRI job had been a year or two ahead of Doug in the Ph.D. program at Berkeley, and Doug told him about his ideas of getting computers to interact with people, in order to augment their intellect.
  Now don't tell anybody else.
  It will sound too crazy.
  It will prejudice people against you."
  So Doug kept quiet about it.
  For about a year and a half, he earned his living and learned the ropes in the think-tank business and thought about putting his ideas into a written proposal.
  Then he told his superiors that he was willing to work hard to pay his way at the institute but he really had to have a framework to cultivate his idea -- an augmentation laboratory where people and machines could experiment with new ways of creating and sharing knowledge, or at least a project to describe exactly what an augmentation laboratory might be.
