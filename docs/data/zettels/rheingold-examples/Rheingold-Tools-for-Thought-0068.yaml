  As it turned out, his heroic and secret war work helped to make him the victim of scientific politics, not their master.
  His reports on the hardware and software design for ACE were ambitious, and if the machine he originally envisioned had been constructed as soon as it was designed, it would have put ENIAC to shame.
  While a succession of other men took over the direction of the computer projects at the National Physical Laboratory and at the University of Manchester, Turing hovered at the periphery of the political power while he put his mind to the actual construction of one of his long-imaginary universal machines.
  In this he was hampered by the attitude prevalent among his peers that upper-middle-class Cambridge theoreticians simply did not get their hands dirty with "engineering."
  But rigid conformity to social standards was not Alan's strong point.
  He forged ahead with what he knew was important -- the development of a science of software.
  Programming Turing's ideas about the proper approach to computer design stressed the need to build computing capabilities into the program, not the hardware.
  He was particularly interested in the programming operations -- or "coding," as it was already coming to be called -- by which truly interesting mathematical operations, and possibly "thinking" itself, eventually might be simulated by an electronic computer.
  And while Turing's first attempt at writing programming languages would be considered crude by today's standards, his ideas were far more advanced than the state of the hardware then available.
  While his colleagues and the American team scrambled to put together the most elementary models of electronic digital computers, Turing was already looking far beyond the clumsy contraptions constructed in the late forties and early fifties.
