  But that night I was excessively tormented, and I kept on going until I had crossed the Mississippi River into Illinois and was 189 miles from where I started.
  I knew I had to quit; I saw a light, which turned out to be a roadhouse, and I went in.
  It was probably zero outside, and I remember hanging up my heavy coat; I started to drink and commenced to warm up and realized that I had control of myself.
  Nearly forty years later, when he testified in the patent case concerning the invention of the electronic computer, Atanasoff recalled that he decided upon several design elements and principles that night in the roadhouse -- including a binary system for encoding input and electronic tube technology for switching -- that would transform his dream of an electronic calculator into a practical plan.
  The state of each inventor's mind at the time of their discussions in 1940 and 1941 was the crux of the legal and historical conflict.
  There is no dispute that John Mauchly had also devoted years of thought to the idea of automated calculation.
  Thirty-three years old when he met Atanasoff, Mauchly had worked his way through Johns Hopkins as a research assistant, which gave him extensive experience with procedures that involve detailed measurement and calculation.
  In 1933, as head of the physics department at Ursinus College near Philadelphia, he began to perform research in atmospheric electricity.
  Mauchly was particularly interested in the long-disputed theory about the effect of sunspots on the earth's weather.
  There was no obvious connection between these huge storms on the sun and terrestrial weather conditions, but that did not prove that such a connection did not exist.
