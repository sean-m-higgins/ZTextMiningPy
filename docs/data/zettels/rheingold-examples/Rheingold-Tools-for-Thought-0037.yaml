  On the one side are scientists and engineers, who would always yearn for a device to take care of tedious computations for them, freeing their thoughts for the pursuit of more interesting questions.
  On the other side is the more abstract desire of the mathematical mind to capture the essence of human reason in a set of symbols.
  Ada, who immediately understood Babbage's models when she saw them, and who was tutored by De Morgan, the one man in the world best equipped to understand Boole, was the first person to speculate at any length about the operations of machines capable of performing logical as well as numerical operations.
  Boole's work was not published until after Lady Lovelace died.
  Had Ada lived but a few years longer, her powerful intuitive grasp of the principles of programming would have been immeasurably enhanced by the use of Boolean algebra.
  Babbage and Lovelace were British aristocrats during the height of the Empire.
  Despite the derision heaped on Babbage in some quarters for his often-peculiar public behavior, he counted the Duke of Wellington, Charles Dickens, and Prince Albert among his friends.
  Ada had access to the best tutors, the finest laboratory equipment, and the latest books.
  They were both granted the leisure to develop their ideas and the privilege of making fools of themselves of the Royal Society, if they desired.
  Boole was the son of a petty shopkeeper, which wasn't the best route to a good scientific education.
