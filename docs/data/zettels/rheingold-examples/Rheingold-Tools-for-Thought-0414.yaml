  Ha!
  A sucker born every minute.
  Just because you're frozen alive, that doesn't mean you can't still be freezing to death.
  I may be slowed down, but I ain't dumb.
  Sure as hell, I'm freezing to death.
  So, how did I get here?
  No reason not to go over it again for the eleven millionth time.
  Nothing else to do.
  I'm Johnny Mylar, from Peabody, Utah.
  Peabody's claim to fame was Dinah, a life-sized pea-green cement replica of a dinosaur, like me, frozen out of time.
