  Suppose the symbols are "X" and "O".
  Suppose that the device can erase either symbol when it reads it in the active square and replace it with the other symbol (i.e., erase an X and replace it with an O, and vice versa).
  The device also has the ability to move left or right, one square at a time, according to instructions interpreted by the control unit.
  The instructions cause a symbol to be erased, written, or left the same, depending on which symbol is read.
  Any number of games can be constructed using these rules, but they would not all necessarily be meaningful.
  One of the first things Turing demonstrated was that some of the games constructed under these rules can be very sophisticated, considering how crude and automaton-like the primitive operations seem to be.
  The following example illustrates how this game can be used to perform a simple calculation.
  The rules of the game to be played by this Turing machine are simple: Given a starting position in the form of a section of tape with some Xs and Os on it, and a starting square indicated, the device is to perform the actions dictated by a list of instructions and follows the succeeding instructions one at a time until it reaches an instruction that forces it to stop.
  Each instruction specifies a particular action to be performed if there is a certain symbol on the active square at the time it is read.
  There are four different actions; they are the only legal moves of this game.
