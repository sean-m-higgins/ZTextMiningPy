  Before the 1950s, only scientists thought about the idea that information had anything to do with anything.
  Common words like communication and message were given new, technical meanings by Wiener and Claude Shannon, who independently and roughly simultaneously demonstrated that everything from the random motions of subatomic particles to the behavior of electrical switching networks and the intelligibility of human speech is related in a way that can be expressed through certain basic mathematical equations.
  The information-related equations were useful in building computers and telephone networks, but they also had significant impact on all the sciences.
  Research inspired by the information-communication model has provided clues to some of the fundamental features of the universe, from the way the cellular instructions for life are woven into the arrangement of atoms in DNA molecules, to the process by which brain cells encode memory.
  The model has become what Thomas Kuhn calls a "scientific paradigm."
  The two fundamental pillars of this paradigm were Claude Shannon's information and Wiener's cybernetics.
  The significance of these two theoretical frameworks that came to the attention of scientists in the late 1940s and began to surface in public consciousness in the 1950s, and the mass attitude shift they implied, was noted by Paula McCorduck, in her history of artificial intelligence research: Cybernetics recorded the switch from one dominant model, or set of explanations for phenomena, to another.
  Energy -- the notion central to Newtonian mechanics -- was now replaced by information.
  The ideas of information theory, such as coding, storage, noise, and so on, provided a better explanation for a whole host of events, from the behavior of electronic circuits to the behavior of a replicating cell.
  These terms mean pretty much what you'd think.
