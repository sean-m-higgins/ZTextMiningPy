  While he was struggling to prove them all wrong, he conceived an idea for an even more ambitious invention.
  Babbage, already ridiculously deep in one visionary development project, began to dream up another one.
  In 1833 he came up with something far more complex than the device he had failed to build in years of expensive effort.
  If one could construct a machine for performing one kind of calculation, Babbage reasoned, would it be possible to construct a machine capable of performing any kind of calculation?
  Instead of building many small machines to perform different kinds of calculation, would it be possible to make the parts of one large machine perform different tasks at different times, by changing the order in which the parts interact?
  Babbage had stumbled upon the idea of a universal calculating machine, an idea that was to have momentous consequences when Alan Turing--another brilliant, eccentric British mathematician who was tragically ahead of his time--considered it again in the 1930s.
  Babbage called his hypothetical master calculator the "Analytical Engine."
  The same internal parts were to be made to perform different calculations, through the use of different "patterns of action" to reconfigure the order in which the parts were to move for each calculation.
  A detailed plan was made, and redrawn, and redrawn once again.
  The central unit was the "mill," a calculating engine capable of adding numbers to an accuracy of 50 decimal places, with speed and reliability guaranteed to lay the Cornish clergymen calculators to rest.
