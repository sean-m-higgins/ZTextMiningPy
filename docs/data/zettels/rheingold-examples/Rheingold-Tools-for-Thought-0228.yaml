note: |
  Doug Engelbart's voice, as he greets you, is low and soft, as though muted from having traveled a long distance, as though his words have been attenuated by layers of meditation.
  There is something diffident yet warm about the man, something gentle yet stubborn in his nature that wins respect.
  Of course, the original Moses never set foot in the promised Land.
  And he never had the reputation of being an easy man to work with.
  In 1951, Engelbart quit his job at Ames and went to graduate school at the University of California at Berkeley, where one of the first von Neumann architecture computers was being built.
  That was when he began to notice that not only didn't people know what he was talking about, but some presumably "objective" scientists were overly hostile.
  He started saying the wrong things to people who could affect his career, things that simply sounded strange to the other electrical engineers.
  Could I hook it up to a keyboard and get a person to interact with the computer?
  Maybe teach the person typing?"
  The psychology people thought it was great, but computers were hardly their department.
