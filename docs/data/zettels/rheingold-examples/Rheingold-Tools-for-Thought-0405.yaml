  Some of these games involved connecting several "players" at once, via remote computing systems.
  As a result of this experience, Turoff became interested in using computers to mediate a special process developed at Rand, known as the "Delphi Method," in which printed questionnaires and responses circulate among a community of experts.
  Delphi was a way to reach a quick collective judgment about a complex situation; Turoff thought the process was ideally suited to the kind of on-line communications then being demonstrated on the ARPAnet.
  So he started to experiment with a computerized Delphi system.
  In the early 1970s, Turoff had moved to the Office of Emergency Preparedness, where his job wasn't related to his immediate interests in teleconferencing.
  His superiors found out that he was using his computer terminal to experiment with an unauthorized conference system, and there was some on-the-job friction.
  But then came the wage-price freeze of 1971, an action that required the rapid collection and collation of an unprecedented amount of information.
  Turoff's superiors changed their minds.
  The Delphi Conference System was ready just in time.
  In the process of putting it together, the people who designed the system and the people who used it began to discover that some of the system's features just seemed to become popular with the on-line community, with no official urging and often with no connection to the task at hand.
