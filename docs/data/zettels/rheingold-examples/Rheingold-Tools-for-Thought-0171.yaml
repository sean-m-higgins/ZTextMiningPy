  It did occur to him that these new computers were excellent candidates for the super-mechanized libraries that Vannevar Bush had prophesied.
  In 1959, he wrote a book entitled Libraries of the Future, describing how a computer-based system might create a new kind of "thinking center."
  The computerized library as he first described it in his book did not involve anything as extravagant as giving an entire computer to every person who used it.
  Instead he described a setup, the technical details of which he left to the future, by which different humans could use remote extensions of a central computer, all at the same time.
  After he wrote the book, during the exhilarating acceleration of research that began in the post-Sputnik era, Licklider discovered what he and others who were close to developments in electronics came to call "the rule of two": Continuing miniaturization of its most important components means that the cost effectiveness of computer hardware doubles every two years.
  It was true in 1950 and it held true in 1960, and beyond even the wildest imaginings of the transistor revolutionaries, it was still true in 1980.
  A small library of books and articles have been written about the ways this phenomenon has fueled the electronics revolution of the past three decades.
  It looks like it will continue to operate until at least 1990, when personally affordable computers will be millions of times more powerful than ENIAC.
  Licklider then started to wonder about the possibility of devising something far more revolutionary that even a computerized library.
  When it began to dawn on him that this relentlessly exponential rate of growth would make computers over a hundred times as powerful as the PDP-1 at one tenth the cost within fifteen years, Licklider began to think about a system that included both the electronic powers of the computer and the cortical powers of the human operator.
