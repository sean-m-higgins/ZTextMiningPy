note: |
  Engelbart brought some of his ideas to a progressive young company down the road in Palo Alto.
  For a change, here were some people looking to the future.
  Not too much more than a decade out of electrical engineering school themselves, Bill Hewlett, David Packard, and Barney Oliver (their head of research and development) were enthusiastic about Doug's proposal.
  A deal was offered.
  Engelbart drove home, elated.
  On the way home, in typical Engelbart fashion, Doug started thinking about it.
  I had assumed that they knew that the ideas I proposed to them that afternoon were only a bridge to digital electronics.
  And Barney replied that no, they didn't have any plans for getting into computers.
  So I said 'Well, that's a shame, because I guess it cools the deal.
  I have to go the digital route to pursue the rest of what I want to do.'"
