  All of these will be interconnected by telecommunications channels.
  The whole will constitute a labile network of networks -- ever changing in both content and configuration.
  The authors envisioned the creation of an interconnected system of software-based tools that would provide "investment guidance, tax counseling, selective dissemination of information in your field of specialization, announcements of cultural, sport, and entertainment events that fit your interests, etc.
  In the later group will be dictionaries, encyclopedias, indexes, catalogues, editing programs, teaching programs, testing programs, programming systems, data bases, and -- most important -- communication, display, and modeling programs."
  They could have been describing from life the facilities that were available at PARC, ten years later.
  Licklider and Taylor were most emphatic that the impact would be great, on both individuals and organizations, when all the elements, which they could only speculate about in 1968, were perfected sometime in the future: First, life will be happier for the on-line individual because the people with whom one interacts most strongly will be selected more by commonality of interests and goals than by accidents of proximity.
  Second, communication will be more effective, and therefore more enjoyable.
  Third, much communication will be with programs and programmed models, which will be (a) highly responsive, (b) supplementary to one's own capabilities, rather than competitive, and (c) capable of representing progressively more complex ideas without necessarily displaying all the levels of the structure at the same time -- and which will therefore be both challenging and rewarding.
  And fourth, there will be plenty of opportunity for everyone (who can afford a console) to find his calling, for the whole world of information, with all its fields and disciplines, will be open to him -- with programs ready to guide him or to help him explore.
  For the society, the impact will be good or bad, depending mainly on one question: Will "to be on-line" be a privilege or a right?
