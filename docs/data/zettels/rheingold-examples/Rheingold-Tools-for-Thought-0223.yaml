  With all these scientists producing all this knowledge at an unprecedented rate, how was anyone to keep track of it all?
  How would this rapidly expanding body of knowledge benefit anybody if nobody knew how to get the information they needed?
  He urged men of science to turn their efforts to making the increasingly unwieldy accumulation of human knowledge more accessible to individuals.
  But the future technology that Bush foresaw extended beyond the borders of science to the ordinary citizenry.
  The day was coming when not only scientists but ordinary citizens would be required to navigate through ever-more complicated realms of information.
  In the pages of the Atlantic, Bush proposed that a certain device should be developed, a device to improve the quality of human thinking.
  Because one of its functions was to extend human memory, Bush called his hypothetical machine a memex.
  But Bush was one of the first to see that rapid access to large amounts of information could serve as much more than a simple extension of memory.
  Although he described it in terms of the primitive information technologies of the 1940s, the memex was functionally similar to what is now known as the personal computer -- and more.
  Some ideas are like seeds.
