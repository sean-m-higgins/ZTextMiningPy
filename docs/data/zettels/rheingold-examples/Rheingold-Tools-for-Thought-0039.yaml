note: |
  After thousands of years in the same form, Aristotelian logic seemed doomed to remain on the outer boundaries of the metaphysical, never to break through into the more concretely specified realm of the mathematical, because it was still just a matter of words.
  The next level of symbolic precision was missing.
  For over a thousand years, the only logic-based system that was expressible in symbols rigorous and precise enough to be called "mathematical" had been the geometry set down by Euclid.
  Just as Euclid set down the basic statements and rules of geometry in axioms and theorems about spatial figures, Boole set down the basics of logic in algebraic symbols.
  This was no minor ambition.
  While knowledge of geometry is a widely useful tool for getting around the world, Boole was convinced that logic was the key to human reason itself.
  He knew that he had found what every metaphysician from Aristotle to Descartes had overlooked.
  In his first chapter, Boole wrote: 1.
  The design of the following treatise is to investigate the fundamental laws of those operations of the mind by which reasoning is performed; to give expression to them in the symbolic language of a Calculus, and upon this foundation to establish a science of Logic and construct its method .
  To enable us to deduce correct inferences from given premises is not the only object of logic .
