  By leaving such a system hooked up continuously, and posting the access number in one or two places, the grapevine takes care of the rest.
  Come back and read all the messages a week later and you'll discover that a community has created itself.
  The first software that enabled microcomputer owners to set up CBBS was created by Ward Christensen and Randy Seuss, in Chicago, in 1978.
  By 1984, the number of such systems is difficult to determine, but it must at least be in the hundreds, and probably will soon be in the thousands.
  To connect to a BBS, you need a personal computer, a modem, telecommunication software, and a telephone.
  Plug the telephone into the modem, use the communication program to dial the BBS number, then when the computers are connected, the host system will put words on your screen and tell you how to work the system.
  Most people know of these systems, and the underground community of users, because of the movie WarGames, television programs about computer whiz kids, and publicity about dark-side hackers.
  In fact the community has changed so swiftly that piracy, phone-freaking, destructive hacking, and even obsessive interest in how computers work now occupy only a small part of the BBS scene.
  Many bulletin boards have been in existence for years, but even more seem to spring up and die out on a weekly basis.
  In my own limited sampling of the BBS world, over the span of a few months, I encountered teenage philosophers, homespun lecturers of all ages and both sexes willing to ramble about any topic you'd care to name, and I even stumbled onto a couple of on-line religions, both cybernetic and pagan.
