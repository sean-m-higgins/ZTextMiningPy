  Ultimately, his invention became obsolete.
  But his small innovation eventually grew into the industry that later came to dominate the commercial use of computer technology.
  Hollerith made the first important American contribution to the evolution of computation when his superior at the Census Office set him on a scheme for automating the collection and tabulation of data.
  On his superior's suggestion, he worked out a system that used cards with holes punched in them to feed information into an electrical counting system.
  The 1890 census was the point in history where the processing of data as well as the calculation of mathematical equations became the object of automation.
  As it turned out, Hollerith was neither a mathematician nor a logician, but a data processor.
  He was grappling, not with numerical calculation, but with the complexity of collecting, sorting, storing, and retrieving a large number of small items in a collection of information.
  Hollerith and his colleagues were unwitting forerunners of twentieth-century information workers, because their task had to do with finding a mechanical method to keep track of what their organization knew.
  Hollerith was introduced to the task by his superior, John Shaw Billings, who had been worrying about the rising tide of information since 1870, when he was hired by the Census Office to develop new ways to handle large amounts of information.
  Since he was in charge of the collection and tabulation of data for the 1880 and 1890 census, Billings was acutely aware that the growing population of the nation was straining the ability of the government to conduct the constitutionally mandated survey every ten years.
