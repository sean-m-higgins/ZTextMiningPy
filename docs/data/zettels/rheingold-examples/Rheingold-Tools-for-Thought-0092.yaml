  Such dreams would have been akin to an Air Force officer wishing for a ten-thousand-mile-per-hour airplane, except for the fact that another new technology, one that only a few people even thought of applying to mathematical problems, looked as if it might make such a machine possible in theory, if only questionably probable in execution.
  Research in the young field of electronics had been uncovering all sorts of marvelous properties of the vacuum tube.
  Over in Great Britain, the whiz kids at Bletchley Park were using such devices in Colossus, their not-quite-computational code-breaking machine.
  Until the war, electronic vacuum tubes had been used almost exclusively as amplifiers.
  But they could also be used as very fast switches.
  Since the rapid execution of a large number of on/off impulses is the hallmark of digital computation, and vacuum tubes could switch on and off as fast as a million times a second, electronic switching (as opposed to the mechanical switching of Vannevar Bush's machine) was an unbelievably good candidate for the key component of an ultrafast computing machine.
  By 1943, unknown to Goldstine and almost all of his superiors, another, much higher-ranking scientist was also searching for an ultrafast computing machine.
  Goldstine beat the other fellow to it.
  Goldstine found Mauchly and Eckert in 1942.
  John von Neumann, and chance, found Goldstine in 1944.
