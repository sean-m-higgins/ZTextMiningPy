  He had a substantial private income and an additional $10,000 a year from the Institute.
  He was widely known to have a huge repertoire of jokes in several languages, a vast knowledge of risqu limericks, and a casual manner of driving so recklessly that he demolished automobiles at regular intervals, always managing to emerge miraculously unscathed.
  Despite his apparently charmed existence, von Neumann, like Ada Lovelace and Alan Turing, died relatively young.
  Lovelace died of cancer at thirty-six, Turing of cyanide at forty-two, and von Neumann of cancer at fifty-three.
  Like many other Los Alamos veterans, he may have been a victim of exposure to radiation during the early nuclear bomb tests.
  His death came as a shock to all who knew him as a vital, lively, peripatetic, seemingly invulnerable individual.
  Stanislaw Ulam, von Neumann's mathematical colleague and lifelong friend, in a memorial to Johnny published in a mathematical journal shortly after von Neumann's death, described his physical presence in loving detail: Johnny's friends remember him in his characteristic poses: standing before a blackboard or discussing problems at home.
  Somehow his gesture, smile, and the expression of the eyes always reflected the thought or the nature of the problem under discussion.
  He was of middle size, quite slim as a young man, then increasingly corpulent; moving in small steps with considerable random acceleration, but never with great speed.
  A smile flashed on his face whenever a problem exhibited features of a logical or mathematical paradox.
