  He was robust, not the stereotype of the frail and sickly child prodigy.
  Wiener evidently enjoyed the meetings and his central role in them: sometimes he got up from his chair and in his ducklike fashion walked around the circle of tables, holding forth exuberantly, cigar in hand, apparently unstoppable.
  He could be quite unaware of other people, but he communicated his thoughts effectively and struck up friendships with a number of the participants.
  Some were intrigued as much as annoyed by Wiener's tendency to go to sleep and even snore during a discussion, but apparently hearing and digesting what was being said.
  Immediately upon waking he would often make penetrating comments.
  Although the nerve network theory was to suffer a less than glorious fate when neurophysiology progressed beyond what was known about nerve cells in the 1940s, the nerve-net models had already profoundly influenced the design of computers.
  Despite his misgivings about the state of the art in theories of brain functioning, in his 1945 "first Draft," von Neumann adopted the logical formalism proposed by McCulloch and Pitts.
  When the architectural template of all future general-purpose computers was first laid down, the cyberneticists' findings influenced the logical design.
  In 1944 and 1945, Wiener was already thinking about a scientific model involving communication, information, self-control -- an all-embracing way of looking at nature that would include explanations for computers and brains, biology and electronics, logic and purpose.
  He later wrote: "It became clear to me almost at the very beginning that these new concepts of communication and control involved a new interpretation of man, of man's knowledge of the universe, and of society."
