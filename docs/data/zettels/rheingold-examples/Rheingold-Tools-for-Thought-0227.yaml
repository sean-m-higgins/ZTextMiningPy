  Although many of the details took decades to work out, the main elements of what he wanted to achieve came to him all at once: "When I first heard about computers, I understood, from my radar experience, that if these machines can show you information on punchcards and printouts on paper, they could write or draw that information on a screen.
  When I saw the connection between a cathode-ray screen, an information processor, and a medium for representing symbols to a person, it all tumbled together in about half an hour.
  I was designing all kinds of things you might want to do if you had a system like the one Vannevar Bush had suggested -- how to expand it to a theater-like environment, for example, where you could sit with a colleague and exchange information.
  God!
  Think of how that would let you cut loose in solving problems!"
  After thirty often-frustrating years of pursuing a dream that the computer industry has long ignored, Doug Engelbart still can't keep the excitement out of his soft voice and the faraway look out of his eyes when he talks about the prospects he foresaw at twenty-five, and has pursued ever since.
  But he's not sure whether today's generation of computerists, with all their fancy hardware, are getting any closer to the real issues.
  Although history has proved him to be an accurate visionary in many ways, but perhaps a less-than-ideal manager of projects and people, and even his friends use the word "stubborn" in describing his attitudes about his theories, Doug Engelbart still wields the power of a quiet person.
  The magnetism of his long-envisioned goal is still strong for him, so strong that a good deal of it still radiates when he talks about it.
  In 1971, his friend Nilo Lindgren described him in Innovation magazine: When he smiles, his face is wistful and boyish, but once the energy of his forward motion is halted and he stops to ponder, his pale blue eyes seem to express sadness or loneliness.
