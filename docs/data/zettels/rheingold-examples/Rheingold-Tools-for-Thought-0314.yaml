  Gradually it was realized that the form of an expression and manipulation could be of a great help in the conception and manipulation of the meaning for which the expression stood.
  The computer created new needs for language by inverting the traditional process of scientific investigation.
  It made new universes available that could be shaped by theories to produce simulated phenomena.
  The "inverting" of "the traditional process of scientific investigation" noted by Kay was the source of the computer's power of simulation.
  And the ability to simulate ideas in visible form was exactly what a new programming language needed to include in order to use a computer as an imagination amplifier.
  If Piaget was correct and children are both scientists and epistemologists, a tool for simulating scientific investigation could have great impact on how much and how fast young children and adult computer programmers are able to learn.
  According to the rules of scientific induction, first set down by Francis Bacon three hundred years ago, scientific knowledge and the power granted by that knowledge are created by first observing nature, noting patterns and relationships that emerge from those direct observations, then creating a theory to explain the observations.
  With the creation of a machine that "obeyed laws you wanted to be held true," it became possible to specify the laws governing a world that doesn't exist, then observe the representation created by the computer on the basis of those laws.
  Papert called these simulated universes "microworlds," and used LOGO-created microworlds to teach logic, geometry, calculus, and problem-solving to ten-year-olds.
  Part of the fascination of a good video game lies in the visual impact of its microworld representation and the amount of power given to the player to react to it and thus learn how to control it.
