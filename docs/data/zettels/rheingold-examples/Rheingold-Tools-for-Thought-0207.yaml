  When not so transfixed, they often sit at tables strewn with computer printouts over which they pore like possessed students of a cabalistic text.
  They work until they drop, twenty, thirty hours at a time.
  Their food, if they arrange it, is brought to them: coffee, cokes, sandwiches.
  If possible they sleep on cots near the computer.
  But only for a few hours -- then back to the console or the printouts.
  Their rumpled clothes, their unwashed and unshaven faces, and their uncombed hair all testify that they are oblivious to their bodies and to the world in which they move.
  They exist, at least when so engaged, only through and for computers.
  These are computer bums, compulsive programmers.
  They are an international phenomenon.
  Weizenbaum attacked those particularly obsessed specimens among the hackers he called "compulsive programmers" on several grounds besides their unorthodox appearance and dietary habits.
