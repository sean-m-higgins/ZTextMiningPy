  It would be held in a dramatic place far removed from the usual locales of Cambridge, Berkeley, or Palo Alto.
  With all these meetings, Taylor, who was neither an engineer nor a programmer (he was, in fact, a philosophy major and an experimental psychologist by training), began the all-important mixing and sifting of ideas he knew would be necessary to the cohesion of such a large, dispersed, and ambitious project.
  Lasting friendships were built from the give and take.
  I asked them difficult questions.
  Then, after they went back to their laboratories and campuses, their communications increased in both quality and quantity, because they knew each other."
  Taylor also initiated annual conferences of graduate students.
  The best graduate students of the old ARPA researchers had meetings of their own, away from the "older" folks like Taylor, who was, after all, in his midthirties.
  Like the bands of roving builders who planned the Gothic cathedrals of Europe, many of the computer-system builders who participated in the ARPA grad students' meetings were to meet again later at SAIL (Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory) and PARC, and later still at Apple and Microsoft.
  Taylor's idea of connecting the researchers by connecting their computers was inspired by a phrase he read in one of Licklider's 1966 papers, in which he proposed the idea of a very large-scale time-sharing system that he called "an intergalactic network."
  Taylor took it a step farther: If you could build a communication network, why not a computer network?
