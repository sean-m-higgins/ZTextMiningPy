  Then the group decided to make Eric play the role of the person using the system, while everyone else improvised roles as the components of the media room -- input to the user's vision, mobility, hearing, emotions, thoughts.
  In the first try, everyone got into their role with such enthusiasm that Eric was literally swarming with people mimicking him, giving him advice, grimacing.
  He spent his time rather defensively trying to figure who did what.
  It was like a combination of twenty questions and charades, but it revealed something about the bewilderment of even a technically sophisticated computer user when faced with a system that does not explain itself but simply acts.
  In the next experiment, Susan, acting as the person in the middle of such a system, decided to try to take control of the elements, and discovered that all the roles of the different components could be changed radically by adding a "help agent."
  The help agent oriented the user by saying things like "ask her about a place," or "ask him -- he knows what to look for."
  The idea was to create a kind of "informational butler" that would observe both the user and the information system, keep a record of that individual's preferences, strengths, and weaknesses, and actively intervene to help the user find or do what the user wanted to find or do.
  The next day, several of the crew were going to Southern California, to see what a prominent university cognitive science department could tell them about designing machines that people can use.
  About a week later, Brenda and I talked about what she had learned from the cognitive scientists, and the improvisation exercise.
  Naturally, the hired hackers got into the act when the subject of the discussion was how to teach secretaries to use a file management system.
