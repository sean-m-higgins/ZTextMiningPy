  There was some friction, but eventually he was given the go-ahead.
  The U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research, ever vigilant for new knowledge about how humans operate machines, provided a small grant.
  Doug finally got what he wanted -- the freedom to explore a field in which he still had no colleagues.
  Total silence from the community greeted the announcement of the conceptual framework Engelbart had thought about and worked to articulate for over a decade.
  But the few people who happened to be listening happened to be the right people.
  Bob Taylor, a young fellow at NASA who was one of the bright technological vanguard of the post-Sputnik era, one of the new breed of research funders who didn't fear innovation as a matter of reflex, pushed some of the earliest funding of Doug's project.
  Fortunately, by that time another one of the few people who were able to understand Engelbart's vision, J. C. R. Licklider, was moving ahead with his ARPA funding blitz.
  As a result of Licklider's support, time-sharing was coming along rapidly.
  By the early sixties, some of the low-level hardware and software tools to build Doug's dreamed-of high-level methodological and conceptual structures were being tested.
  Licklider and Taylor thought Engelbart was just the kind of forward-thing researcher they wanted to recruit for the task of finding new and powerful uses for the computational tools their research teams were creating.
