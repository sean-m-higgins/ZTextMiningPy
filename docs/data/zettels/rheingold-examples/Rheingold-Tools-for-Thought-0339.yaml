note: |
  The Atari research building was in a typical Sunnyvale flatland industrial park, with the usual high-tech high-security trappings -- twenty-four-hour guards, laminated color-coded nametags, uniformed escorts.
  It was here that I joined Brenda and several of her colleagues in a group-imagination exercise connected with what they called a media-room project.
  Brenda signed me in, walked me through the gray-walled, gray-carpeted corridors, and brought me to a large room, bare except for a few industrial-modern couches and chairs, a videotape setup, and two whiteboards.
  Inside the room were Eric Hulteen, the project leader; Susan, a red-haired, soft-spoken young woman; Scott, a quiet, spaced-out preppie type; Don and Ron Dixon, the Robotic experts; Craig, a somewhat skeptical, bearded hacker; Jeff, Tom, Brenda, and Rachel, who was videotaping the event.
  Rachel was short, had a crewcut, wore a tank-top tee shirt, purple blousy harem pants, and no shoes.
  Don and Ron were twins.
  A few in the group could be as young as twenty-three or twenty-four, the oldest was no older than thirty-five.
  Jeans and sandals were the dominant costume.
  Nobody wore a tie.
  Nobody had acne or a speech impediment.
