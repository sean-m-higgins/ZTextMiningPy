  After asking that single yes or no question, player one either knows that the number is greater than fifty or that it is less than fifty.
  One of the things Shannon demonstrated in 1948 was that the entropy of a system is represented by the logarithm of possible combinations of states in that system -- which is the same as the number of yes-or-no questions that have to be asked to locate one individual case.
  Entropy, as it was redefined by Shannon, is the same as the number of binary decisions necessary to identify a specific sequence of symbols.
  Taken together, those binary decisions, like the answers in the game, constitute a definite amount of information about the system.
  When it comes to arranging molecules, living organisms seem to have a great deal of information about how to take elementary substances and turn them into complex compounds.
  Somehow, living cells manage to take the hodgepodge of molecules found in their environment and arrange them into the substances necessary for sustaining life of the organism.
  From a disorderly environment, living creatures somehow create their own internal order.
  This remarkable property now sounds suspiciously like Maxwell's demon.
  The answer, as we now know, is to be found in the way the DNA molecule arranges its elements -- doing so in such a way that the processes necessary for metabolism and reproduction are encoded.
  The "negative entropy" that Schrodinger says is the nourishment of all life is information, and Shannon showed exactly how such coding can be done -- in molecules, messages, or switching networks.
