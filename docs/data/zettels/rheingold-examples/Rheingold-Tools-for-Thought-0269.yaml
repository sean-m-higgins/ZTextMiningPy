note: |
  Programmers of the first multiaccess computers of the sixties were able to submit programs a piece at a time and receive responses a piece at a time, instead of trying to make the whole programming job work, for better or worse, in a single batch.
  By eliminating the "wait and see" aspect of batch-processing, time-sharing made it possible for programmers to treat their craft as a performing art.
  It was clear, though, that this was an important breakthrough in information processing technology, so I became involved in the technology transfer between the different experimental systems, and eventually to military and civilian computer applications.
  IBM ignored the ARPA stuff at first.
  They simply didn't take it seriously.
  Then GE agreed to cooperate with MIT and Bell Laboratories to develop and market a large time-sharing system.
  IBM said, 'Whoops, something's happening here,' and they went off with a crash project to retrofit one of their 360 systems to time-sharing.
  They took orders for a few and the system bombed.
  They couldn't make the software work because hadn't been down the same roads that the ARPA funded groups had been down years before."
  Time-sharing research caused a kind of schism in the corporate research field.
