note: |
  Six months after I talked to Alan Kay and observed Brenda Laurel's research group, the Systems Research Group was fired en masse.
  Brenda and Eric were given five minutes' notice.
  Alan went to Apple shortly thereafter.
  Once again, as in the case of ARC and PARC, it seemed that the management of the corporation that nurtured the most exciting research in interactive, mind-augmenting computer systems seemed to fail miserably when it came to developing products.
  After she was fired, Brenda was a lot more willing to talk about the pressures of doing long-term research for a consumer-product-oriented company.
  In her opinion, the explanation for the demise of Atari Research, and the dramatic reversal of Atari Corporation's fortunes that led to the drastic cutback, is a simple one.
  The people they hired to run Atari were from Burlington Industries, Philip Morris, Proctor and Gamble -- dog food boys.
  How often does dog food change?"
  Before she was in Systems Research, Brenda was in marketing.
  She claims that she told Raymond Kassar (former CEO of Atari) that "what people are going to want from us is not more deadhead entertainment, but stuff that helps their minds grow.
