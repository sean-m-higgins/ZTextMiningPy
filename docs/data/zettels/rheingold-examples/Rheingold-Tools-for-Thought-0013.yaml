  Although individual contributors to the past two or three decades of computer research development have been abundant, the people who have been able to see some kind of overall direction to the fast, fragmented progress of recent years have been sparse.
  Just as the earliest logicians and mathematicians didn't know their thoughts would end up as a part of a machine, the vast majority of the engineers and programmers of the 1960s were unaware that their machines had anything to do with human thought.
  The latter day computer pioneers in the middle chapters of this book were among the few who played central roles in the development of personal computing.
  Like their predecessors, these people tried to create a kind of mental lever.
  Unlike most of their predecessors, they were also trying to design a tool that the entire population might use.
  Where the original software patriarchs solved various problems in the creation of the first computers, the personal computer pioneers struggled with equally vexing problems involved in using computers to create leverage for human intellect, the way wheels and dynamos create leverage for human muscles.
  Where the patriarchs were out to create computation, the pioneers sought to transform it: J.C.R.
  Licklider, an experimental psychologist at MIT who became the director of the Information Processing Techniques Office of the U.S. Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), was the one man whose vision enabled hundreds of other like-minded computer designers to pursue a whole new direction in hardware and software development.
  In the early 1960s, the researchers funded by Licklider's programs reconstructed computer science on a new and higher level, through an approach known as time-sharing.
  Although their sponsorship was military, the people Licklider hired or supported were working toward a transformation that he and they believed to be social as well as technological.
