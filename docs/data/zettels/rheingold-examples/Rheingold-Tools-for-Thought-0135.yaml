  Fano was working on his doctoral thesis in electrical engineering.
  From time to time, Wiener would walk into the student's office, inform him rather cryptically that "information is entropy," and walk out without saying another word.
  By the end of 1946, Wiener had reached a decision that had nothing to do with the cold formalisms of mathematics, a decision that distinguished him in yet another way from his weaponry-oriented colleague.
  Renouncing any future role in weapons-related research, Wiener deliberately removed himself from the hot center of the action in the development of computer technology (as opposed to cybernetic theory) when he stated: "I do not expect to publish any future work of mine which may do damage in the hands of irresponsible militarists."
  Fortunately for Wiener, and for the scientific world, the implications of his discoveries were not limited to military applications.
  It quickly became evident that weapons were not the only things of interest that were built from communication and control codes.
  By the late forties and early fifties, the atmosphere was crackling with new scientific ideas having to do with what nobody yet called information theory.
  The quantum physicist Erwin Shroedinger gave a famous lecture at Cambridge University in 1945, later published, on the topic "What is Life?"
  One of the younger physicists in the audience, Francis Crick, decided to switch to biology, where the most crucial decoding problem in scientific history was waiting for him.
  Von Neumann turned out to be right in his dispute with Wiener -- the bacteriophage, not the nervous system, was the subject of the next great decoding.
