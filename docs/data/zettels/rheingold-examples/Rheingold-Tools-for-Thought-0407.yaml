  Some kinds of teleconferencing software were created in order to make it possible to post a message on the topic of zucchini or microprocessors (or emergency preparedness procedures, or organizing an airlift) and be sure that the messages would be transmitted to everyone who needed to know about those topics.
  The use of a computer-mediated message system, as Turoff understood, ultimately created several new social phenomena.
  It was obvious from the vigorous electronic mail traffic on the ARPAnet that some new kind of conversation was going on.
  At a technical level, the users of these systems were able to share computer resources and research findings, as they were supposed to.
  But it also turned out that whenever people are introduced to a computer network, they seem to want to use it to communicate with each other.
  People on the ARPAnet devoted hours to composing messages.
  For the small community of people who had access to such systems, the continuing dialogues on AI and foreign policy, space shuttles and space-war, diatribes, puns, puzzles, pranks, and running jokes became a kind of combination electronic water-cooler and customized daily news medium.
  All the other news media were collapsed into subsets of the new one, since it was no problem to plug the wire services into the system.
  The metamedium seemed to foster new kinds of values, as well.
  Iconoclasm, debate, the right to an unbridled heterogeneity of interests seemed to be highly valued in the emerging on-line community.
