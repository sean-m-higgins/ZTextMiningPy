  Time-sharing, tremendously exciting as it was to programmers, was seen as only a means to an end by those who were aiming to build communication amplifiers.
  To those who were gung-ho about the future of multiaccess computing, Taylor and Licklider talked about the ultimate goal of the various projects they had initiated: the creation of tools to enhance the thinking of individuals and augment communications among groups of people.
  Engelbart's group at SRI, Ivan Sutherland's computer graphics work at MIT and Harvard, David Evans and his students at the University of Utah, the Project MAC hackers at MIT, and other groups scattered around the country were constructing pieces of a whole new technology.
  Foreseeing the day when such systems would be practical on a large scale, Licklider and Taylor reminded their colleagues that the new information processing technology could revolutionize not only research centers and universities, but offices, factories, and ultimately schools and homes.
  Looking toward what was then the long-term future, Licklider and Taylor projected a positive attitude about the possible impact of supercommunities that might include not only computer scientists and programmers but housewives, schoolkids, office workers and artists: But let us be optimistic.
  What will on-line interactive communities be like?
  In most fields they will consist of geographically separated members, sometimes grouped in small clusters and sometimes working individually.
  They will be communities not of common location but of common interest.
  In each field, the overall community of interest will be large enough to support a comprehensive system of field-oriented programs and data.
  In each geographical sector, the total number of users -- summed over all the fields of interest -- will be large enough to support extensive general-purpose information processing and storage facilities.
