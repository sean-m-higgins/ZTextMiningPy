note: |
  Von Neumann's ideas about self-reproducing automata -- patterns complex enough and highly ordered enough to direct their own replication -- seemed to point toward the same idea.
  Something about order and disorder, messages and noise, was near the heart of life.
  The manipulation of information looked like something more like a game mathematicians play, even more than a capability of machines.
  Information, in a way that was not mathematically demonstrated until Claude Shannon's 1948 publications, began to look like a reflection of the way the universe works.
  The whole idea was a wrenching of mind-set, at first for scientists, then for many others.
  At the beginning of the twentieth century, scientists saw the universe in terms of particles and forces interacting in complicated but orderly patterns that were, in principle, totally predictable.
  In important ways, all of the nonscientists who lived in an increasingly mechanized civilization also saw the universe in terms of particles and forces and a clockwork cosmos.
  Around sixty years ago, quantum theory did away with the clockwork and predictability.
  Around thirty years ago, a few people began to look at the world and see, as Norbert Wiener put it, "a myriad of To Whom It May Concern messages."
  The idea that information is still a fundamental characteristic of the cosmos, like matter and energy, is still young, and further surprise discoveries and applications are sure to pop up before a better model comes along.
