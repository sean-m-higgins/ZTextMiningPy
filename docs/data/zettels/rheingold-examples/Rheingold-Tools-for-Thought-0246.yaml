  The content of the information displayed on the screen referred to the lecture he was giving at the moment, and the lecture referred to the information on the screen -- an example of the kind of self-referential procedure that programmers call "recursion."
  Doug moved his audience's attention through the outline by the way he manipulated their "views" of the information.
  His manipulations maneuvered the screen display and the audience's consciousness through categories of information, zoomed down to subcategories, broke them into their atomic components, rearranged them, then zoomed back up the hierarchy to meet the vocal narration at a key point in the story, when the words on the screen and the words coming from the narrator merged before branching off again.
  It was an appropriately dramatic presentation of a then-novel use of computers.
  While it appeared to be a radically sudden innovation to many of those in the audience, it was the culmination of careful experimentation at ARC that had already spanned most of a decade.
  It is almost shocking to realize that in 1968 it was a novel experience to see someone use a computer to put words on a screen, and in this era of widespread word processing, it is hard to imagine today that very few people were able to see in Doug's demonstration the vanguard of an industry.
  When time-sharing systems first allowed programmers to interact directly with computers, in the early 1960s, the programmers developed tools known as "text editors" to help them write programming code.
  But "word processing" for non-programmers was still far in the future, despite Engelbart's demonstration of its potential.
  The quality of video display technology in 1968 was also amazingly primitive by today's standards.
  The letters and numbers on Doug's screen looked as if they were handwritten -- closer to crude swaths "painted" onto a radar screen than the crisp pixels we are accustomed to seeing today on video display terminals.
