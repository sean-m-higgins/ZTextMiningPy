note: |
  Ancient observers noticed the similarity between the changes undergone by a butterfly pupa and those of the human mind when it undergoes the kind of transformation associated with a radical new way of understanding the world -- in fact the Greek word for both butterfly and soul is psyche.
  After the caterpillar has wound itself with silk, extraordinary changes begin to happen within its body.
  Certain cells, known to biologists as imaginal cells, begin to behave very differently from their normal caterpillar cells.
  Soon, these unusual cells begin to affect cells in their immediate vicinity.
  The imaginal cells begin to grow into colonies throughout the body of the transforming pupa.
  Then, as the caterpillar cells begin to disintegrate, the new colonies link to form the structure of the butterfly's body.
  At some point, an integrated supercolony of transformed cells that had once crawled along the ground emerges from the cocoon and flies off into the spring sky on multicolored wings.
  If there is a positive image of the future of human-computer relations, perhaps it is to be seen reflected in the shapes of the imaginal cells of the information culture -- from eight-year-olds with fantasy amplifiers to knowledge engineers, from Ted Nelson to Murray Turoff, from Clyde Ghost Monster to Sourcevoid Dave, from ARPA to ORIGINS.
  The flights of the infonauts are not the end of the journey begun by the patriarchs, but the beginning of the most dramatic software odyssey of them all.
  It is up to us to decide whether or not computers will be our masters, our servants, or our partners.
