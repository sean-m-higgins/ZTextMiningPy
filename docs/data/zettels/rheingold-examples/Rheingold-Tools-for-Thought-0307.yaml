  Logo In the course of preparing his Ph.D. thesis, Alan began to explore the world of artificial intelligence research, which brought him into closer contact with two more computer scientists who were to heavily influence his own research -- Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert, who were then codirectors of MIT's pioneering artificial intelligence research project.
  In the late 1960s, Papert in particular was doing something that irrevocable influenced Alan's goals.
  Papert was creating a new computer language.
  For children.
  Papert, a mathematician and one of the early heroes of the myth-shrouded Project Mac, had spent five years in Switzerland, working with the developmental psychologist Jean Piaget.
  Piaget had triggered his own revolution in learning theory by spending time -- years and decades -- watching children learn.
  He concluded that learning is not simply something adults impose upon their offspring through teachers and classrooms, but is a deep part of the way children are innately equipped to react to the world, and that children construct their notions of how the world works, from the material available to them, in definite stages.
  Piaget was especially interested in how different kinds of knowledge are acquired by children, and concluded that children are scientists -- they perform experiments, formulate theories, and test their theories with more experiments.
  To the rest of us, this process is known as "playing," but to children it is a vital form of research.
  Papert recognized that the responsiveness and representational capacity of computers might allow children to conduct their research on a scale never possible in a sandbox or on a blackboard.
