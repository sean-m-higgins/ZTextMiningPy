note: |
  If this linkage of such disparate ideas as "heat," "average motion," and "order of a system" sounds confusing, you have a good idea of how nineteenth-century physicists felt.
  For a long time, they thought that heat was some kind of invisible fluid that was transferred from one object to another.
  When it was discovered that heat is way of characterizing a substance in which the molecules were, on the average, moving around faster than the molecules in a "cold" substance, a new way of looking at systems consisting of large numbers of parts (molecules, in this case) came into being.
  And this new way of looking at the way the parts of systems are arranged led, eventually, to the entropy-information connection.
  Because "average motion" of molecules is a statistical measure, saying something about the amount of heat in a system says something about they way the parts of that system are arranged.
  Think about a container of gas.
  The system in this case includes everything inside the container and everything outside the container.
  The gas is considered to be hot if the average energy of the molecules inside the container is higher than the average energy of the molecules outside the container.
  Some of the molecules inside the container might, in fact, be less energetic (cooler) than some of the molecules outside the container -- but on the average, the population of molecules inside are more energetic than the population of the molecules outside.
  There is a certain order to this arrangement -- energetic molecules are more likely to be found inside the container, less energetic molecules are more likely to be found outside.
