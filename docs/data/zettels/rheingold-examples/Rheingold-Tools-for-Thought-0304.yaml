  Ed had an idea about doing a tabletop computer.
  Kay worked on FLEX -- his first personal computer software design -- from 1967 to 1969.
  While some of the founders of today's personal computer industry were still in high school, Kay was learning how to design personal computers.
  Technically, Cheadle and Kay were not the first to attempt to build a personal computer.
  Wes Clark, from Whirlwind and Lincoln Lab's TX-2 and "imps," had constructed a desk-size machine a few years before, known as "LINC."
  FLEX was an attempt to use the more advanced electronic components that had recently become available to bring more of the computer's power out where the individual user could interact with it.
  FLEX was a significant innovation technically, but it was complicated and delicate, and in Kay's words, "users found it repellent to learn."
  The problem wasn't in the machinery as much as it was in the special language the user had to master in order to command the power of the machine to accomplish useful tasks.
  That was when Kay first vowed to make sure his personal computer would come at least part of the way toward the person who was to use it, and when he realized that software design would be the area in which this desire could be fulfilled.
  Although he didn't fully realize it yet, Alan Kay was beginning to think about designing a new programming language.
