  Because he started out young in a field that was young itself, Kay was one of the first of the generation of infonauts, the ones who grew up with the tools created by the pioneers, and who have been using them to create a medium for the rest of us.
  One of the things he learned at ARPA and Utah, Sail and PARC, Atari and Apple, was that putting together a group of talents and leaving them alone might be the most important ingredient in invoking the breakthroughs he'll need to complete his dream.
  People are beginning to wonder what Kay, now at Apple, intends to do next.
  A hotshot programmer at Apple put it differently: "He deserves to be called a visionary, because he is.
  And I love to hang around him because he knows so much about so many things.
  But it gets a little tiring the third time you hear him say, 'We already did that back in '74.'
  Because of what happened -- or didn't happen -- with the Atari team, he probably learned that being a member of a team, albeit an inspirational, even visionary member, doesn't necessarily mean that he is cut out to be a good leader.
  Before we explore the end of the dream at Atari, however, another infonaut by the name of Brenda will give us a glimpse at part of what Kay and his cohorts attempted to accomplish.Chapter Twelve: Brenda and the Future Squad To those of us who don't live and work in futurist sanctums like ARC, PARC, Atari, or Apple, such activities as flying through information space or having first-person interactions with a computer are hard to imagine in terms of what one would like to do on a Friday night.
  There simply aren't any analogous images available in our cultural metaphor-bank: Is it like watching television?
  Playing a video game?
