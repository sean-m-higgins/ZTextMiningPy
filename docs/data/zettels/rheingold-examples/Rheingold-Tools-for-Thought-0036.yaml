note: |
  The problem of the late 1930s was that nobody knew of any mathematical operations that had the power to describe both logical and electrical networks.
  Then the right kind of mind looked in the right place.
  An exceptionably astute graduate student at MIT named Claude Shannon, who later invented information theory, found Boole's algebra to be exactly what the engineers were looking for.
  Without Boole, a poverty-stricken, self-taught mathematics teacher who was born the same year as Ada, the critical link between logic and mathematics might never have been accomplished.
  While the Analytical Engine was an inspiring attempt, it had remarkably little effect on the later thinkers who created modern computers.
  Without Boolean algebra, however, however, computer technology might never have progressed to the electronic speeds where truly interesting computation becomes possible.
  Boole was right about the importance of his vision, although he wouldn't have known what to do with a vacuum tube or a switching circuit if he saw one.
  Unlike Babbage, Boole was not an engineer.
  What Boole discovered in that meadow and worked out on paper two decades later was destined to become the mathematical linchpin that coupled the logical abstractions of software with the physical operations of electronic machines.
  Between them, Babbage's and Boole's inspirations can be said to characterize the two different kinds of motivation that caused imaginatives over the centuries to try and eventually to succeed in building a computer.
