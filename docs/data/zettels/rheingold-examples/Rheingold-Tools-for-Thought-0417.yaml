  I met Clyde Ghost Monster one night out in the bulletin board zone, and Clyde ultimately turned me on to the number that led me to the on-line religion.
  It started the way it usually does when you browse the boards.
  A list of bulletin board numbers had led me to a list of bulletin board numbers that led me to another lively discussion group called "Sunrise" in New Jersey, consisting of random drop-ins from anywhere in the country, like me, and a core group, mostly local, who seemed to know each other, and who spent hours trading messages about utterly anything at all.
  While some boards are strictly for hackers or computer enthusiasts or science-fiction freaks or sex freaks or peace types, Sunrise appeared to be a kind of electronic cracker-barrel store crossed with a public restroom wall.
  I joined Sunrise as "Johnny Jupiter" when I decided to add my two cents to a very funny ongoing conference that consisted of nothing but lists of "my favorite people."
  You can say a lot with just a list of people, the Sunrise community discovered one night, when "Ivan Idea" started it all by posting the first list.
  The creators of the lists that followed within hours signed themselves with names like "Tater Tot," "Clock Speed," and "Clyde Ghost Monster."
  I checked in on Sunrise from week to week, and one night, while scrawling some graffitist reply to an ongoing epistemological debate, the words "SYSOP REQUESTS CHAT" appeared on my screen.
  I typed "OKAY LET'S CHAT," hit the return key, and started conversing in real time with an utterly fascinating individual, via an exchange of quickly typed messages.
  It turned out that the host computer was located in Clyde Ghost Monster's bedroom, which made Clyde the system operator.
