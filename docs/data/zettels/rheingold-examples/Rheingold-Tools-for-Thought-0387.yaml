note: |
  Pattern recognition in artificial vision or hearing, the ability to understand natural language, the emulation of problem-solving, the design of an intelligent computer interface -- all of these research questions involve the nature of understanding.
  We don't know what the purpose of understanding is, or why you have to know a whole lot about the world in general to recognize a face or understand a sentence.
  And I think that the descendants of today's knowledge-based expert systems will help us all to better understanding.
  Each of us will be able to understand better because we'll be interacting with people and with information through the assistance of expert tools.
  They may even help us understand things that nobody understands."
  Few people object to the notion of understanding things that nobody understands -- until it is suggested that the agent for achieving that understanding might be an intelligence that is made of silicon rather than protoplasm.
  The AI infonauts might be on a track that ultimately will bypass the near-future technologies that augment, but do not surpass, human intelligence.
  If Barr and his colleagues are correct, then their ideas offer strong reinforcement for the speculations that Licklider made in 1960, when he introduces the idea of a coming human-machine symbiosis.
  Licklider suggested that such a symbiosis was an intermediate step for the interim decades or centuries before the machines surpass our ability to keep up with them.
  Even if the human-machine partnership is to be an intermediate relationship, lasting only a few human generations, those next few generations promise to be exciting indeed.
