  In 1977, the National Science Foundation funded the NJIT to build "an electronic communication laboratory for use by geographically dispersed research communities."
  By July, 1978, seven trial projects were under way, each one a part of an established research community of ten to fifty members.
  The system was set up to collect data on its own operations, in order to test the hypothesis that a teleconference-like system could enhance the effectiveness of research communities.
  The Electronic Information Exchange System, known as EIES (pronounced "eyes"), was one of those experiments that never shut itself down because the experimental subjects just wouldn't let go of it.
  It seemed to happen with every new development of interactive computing -- people would simply refuse to stop experimenting with the system, and wouldn't give up the experimental tools when the experiment was over.
  As Jim Fadiman noted of ARC, people seem to be as reluctant to be deaugmented as they are resistant to augmentation in the first place.
  EIES was first set up to enable members to send private communications to individuals or groups, maintain permanent transcripts of comments on discussion topics, and provide text processing and file management services that participants could use to construct jointly authored papers.
  The protocols for using all the communication features, like Engelbart's NLS system, were not easy to learn.
  It took some commitment to the idea that it was worthwhile learning, which is one reason why research communities were ideal laboratories for the experiment.
  EIES quickly expanded from pure scientific research communities to legislative researchers and medical researchers.
