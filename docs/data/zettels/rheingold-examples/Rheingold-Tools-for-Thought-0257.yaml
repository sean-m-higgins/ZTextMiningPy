  The way Engelbart saw it, it was time to bring the system out of the research world, after its extended gestation, to test it on a community of real-world users.
  The way SRI saw it was that the whole project was obviously finished as a magnet for research funds, and they might as well sell it.
  In 1977, SRI sold the entire augmentation system to Tymshare Corporation, and Engelbart went with it.
  The system, renamed "Augment," is now marketed by Tymshare as one of their office automation services.
  Nobody disputes that Engelbart's vision was the single factor that stayed stable through twenty of the most turbulent years of computer science, and those few colleagues who know of his importance to the evolution of computing are loathe to speak unkindly of him, yet the tacit consensus is that Doug Engelbart the visionary allowed himself to remain fascinated by an obsolescent vision.
  NLS was powerful but very complex, and the notion of a kind of knowledge elite who learned complex and difficult languages to operate information vehicles is not as fashionable in the world of less sophisticated but more egalitarian personal computers created by Engelbart's students.
  The twelve years of ARC's heyday at SRI, from 1963 to 1975, were technologically wild years.
  That period was one of enormous historical, social, and cultural upheavals, as well.
  Mistakes, conflicts, blind alleys, and other pitfalls were unavoidable during the course of a project that began in the Kennedy administration and continued throughout the years of the Vietnam war, campus revolts, assassinations, the emergence of the counterculture, the advent of women's liberation, Watergate, and ended during the Carter administration.
  As individuals, and as a group, ARC wasn't immune to the conflicts that affected the rest of the culture, although it was privy to its own mutated forms of it.
