  For the first time, the trajectory of a shell could be calculated in less time than it took an actual shell to travel to its target.
  But the firing tables were no longer the biggest boom on the block by the time ENIAC was completed.
  The first problem run on the machine, late in the winter of 1945, was a trial calculation for the hydrogen bomb then being designed.
  After his first accidental meeting with Goldstine at Aberdeen, and the demonstration of a prototype ENIAC soon afterward, von Neumann joined the Moore School project as a special consultant.
  Johnny's genius for formal, systematic, logical thinking was applied to the logical properties of this huge maze of electronic circuits.
  The engineering problems were still formidable, but it was becoming clear that the nonphysical component, the subtleties of setting up the machine's operations -- the coding, as they began to call it -- was equally difficult and important.
  Until the transistor came along a few years later, ENIAC would represent the physical upper limit of what could be done with a large number of high-speed switches.
  In 1945, the most promising approach to greater computing power was in improving the logical structure of the machine.
  And von Neumann was probably the one man west of Bletchley Park equipped to understand the logical attributes of the first digital computer.
  Part of the reason ENIAC was able to operate so fast was that the routes followed by the electronic impulses were wired into the machine.
