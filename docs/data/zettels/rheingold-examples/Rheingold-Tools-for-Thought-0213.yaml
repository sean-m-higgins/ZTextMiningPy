note: |
  As might well be expected, this diatribe did not go unanswered.
  As usual, opinion was heatedly divided.
  Some -- a minority, of course -- agreed wholeheartedly with the heresy.
  Hackers as a group harbor a love for heresy, iconoclasm, and debating whether something is or is not heretical, even if -- especially if -- the topic relates to hackers themselves.
  Of those who rebutted Gandalf, the one known as "A.
  Anonymous" offered the West Coast version of the "Minsky defense": We are dealing with an infinitely malleable tool.
  People who choose to develop and use that tool, whether for work, play, or both, have that choice and cannot be denied it.
  A person who chooses to be a musician must devote hours and hours to gain adequate expertise.
  But would you consider the computer hacker any less creative than such a person?
  I certainly wouldn't.
