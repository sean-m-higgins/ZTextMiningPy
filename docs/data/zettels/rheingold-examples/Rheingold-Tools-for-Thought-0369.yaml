  GUIDON is an education expert system that teaches students by correcting answers to technical questions.
  GENESIS assists scientists in planning cloning experiments.
  TATR helps the Air Force plan attacks on enemy airbases.It's hard to argue with a molybdenum deposit or a significantly high rate of successful diagnoses.
  As the debate over whether software is capable of acting intelligently dies down in what mathematicians call an "existence proof," the question of whether computer technology ought to be applied to such areas as medicine, air traffic control, nuclear power plant operations, or nuclear weapons delivery systems is just beginning.
  Some critics, prominent members of the artificial intelligentsia among them, have been sounding alarms over the potential ethical dangers of relying too much on electronic artifacts like expert systems to make decisions.
  Joseph Weizenbaum fears that there is great peril in relying too much on a technology that is very good at mimicing what are actually much deeper human thought processes.
  Expert systems are the epitome of the kind of "imperialism of instrumental reasoning" Weizenbaum rails against -- the kind of thinking that sees all problems as solvable through the kind of analytical, mechanical processes a computer uses.
  In a 1983 interview, Weizenbaum said: "To think that one can take a very wise teacher, for example, and by observing her capture the essence of that person to any significant degree is simply absurd.
  I'd say people who have that ambition, people who think that it's going to be that easy or possible at all, are simply deluded."
  Avron Barr is a knowledge engineer who does not feel that he is deluded, and knowledge-based educational systems happen to be one of the areas of his expertise.
