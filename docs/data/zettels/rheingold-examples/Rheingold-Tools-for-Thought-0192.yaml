  Those people knew what was happening to me, and when I began programming, they encouraged it."
  MIT, to begin with, was the engineers' school of engineers' schools, where the undergraduates hold an annual "ugliest man on campus" contest -- an unashamed, self-proclaimed, national haven for supernerds.
  The campus population was primarily composed of the people from all the high schools in the country who stayed home and learned integral calculus or built ham radios while everybody else was at the sock hop.
  Amid all this self-styled rejection of conventional youth culture and the atmosphere of cultivated unfashionability, computer obsessives were considered oddballs even by the other outcasts.
  Their standards were entirely their own.
  They and their computers, and a few people in ARPA, were the only ones who knew that the top hackers were really the insiders.
  Although they were outcasts from the wider society, from their fellow techies, and even from most other computer scientists, they happened to be the people who were creating the future of computing -- the first time-sharing systems.
  They were having so much fun with what they all knew to be the hot technology of the future that they seemed to deliberately encourage their unappetizing image.
  You don't just barge in and make yourself a hacker.
  You've gotta hack.
