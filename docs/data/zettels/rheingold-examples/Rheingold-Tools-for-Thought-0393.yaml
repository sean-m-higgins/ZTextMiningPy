note: |
  Unsettled as his future might be, what he had in the past was the foresight, the orneriness, and the tenacity to talk clearly and plainly about the computer empire's new clothes.
  Ted Nelson was another one of the few people who saw the personal augmentation potential of computers early in the game and grasped the significance of the work being done at Utah, SRI, MIT and PARC.
  Unlike many of the more sheltered academics, he also saw the potential of a hobbyist "underground."
  Nelson chose to bypass (and thereby antagonize) both the academic and industrial computerists by appealing directly to the public in a series of self-published tracts that railed against the pronouncements of the programming priesthood.
  Nelson's books, Computer Lib, The Home Computer Revolution, and Literary Machines, not only gave the orthodoxy blatant Bronx Cheers -- they also ventured dozens of predictions about the future of personal computers, many of which turned out to be strikingly accurate, a few of which turned out to be bad guesses.
  As a forecaster in a notoriously unpredictable field, Ted Nelson has done better than most -- at forecasting.
  His business and scholarly ventures have yet to meet with success in either the academic establishment or the computer marketplace.
  He has a history of disenchanting and antagonizing the people who have enough respect for his wild talents to take the risk of hiring him.
  He's currently on his "third career crash."
  Like so many other computer prodigies, Ted Nelson started his often lonely and always stubbornly unique intellectual journey when he first realized what they were trying to do to him in school.
