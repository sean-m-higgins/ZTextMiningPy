  Next, they had to find potential areas of application -- a task that didn't take nearly as long.
  About two dozen corporations are currently developing and selling expert systems and services.
  TeKnowledge, founded by Feigenbaum and associates in 1981, was the first.
  IntelliGenetics is perhaps the most exotic, specializing in expert systems for the genetic engineering industry.
  Startups in this field tend toward science-fictionoid names -- Machine Intelligence Corporation, Computer Thought Corporation, Symbolics, etc.
  Other companies already established in non-AI areas have entered the field -- Xerox, DEC, IBM, Texas Instruments, and Schlumberger among them.
  Expert systems are now in commercial and research use in a number of fields.
  A partial sampling: KAS (Knowledge Acquisition System) and TEIRESIAS help knowledge engineers build expert systems.
  ONCOCIN assists physicians in managing complex drug regimens for treating cancer patients.
  MOLGEN helps molecular biologists plan DNA experiments.
