note: |
  One of the programmers at the staff meeting summarized the problem by asking, 'how do we get a secretary to understand that slash-single quote-DEL will delete a file?'
  That was his understanding of the human interface -- a matter of figuring out how to adapt a human to the esoteric communication protocol some programmer built into a machine."
  That part of a computer game that makes the user step outside the game world, that doesn't help the user to participate in the pleasure of the game, but acts as a tool for talking to the program -- that's where distance comes in.
  That's what happens to the secretary when the programmer tells her that slash-single quote-DEL means "erase this."
  She doesn't want to ask the computer to erase it; she simply wants to erase it.
  What Brenda was getting at seemed so strange and so counter to everything I had been taught that it took a while for it to sink in: In essence, she was saying that when it comes to computer software, the human habit of looking at artifacts as tools can get in the way.
  Good tools ought to disappear from one's consciousness.
  You don't try to persuade a hammer to pound a nail -- you pound the nail, with the help of a hammer.
  But computer software, as presently constituted, forces us to learn arcane languages so we can talk to our tools instead of getting on with the task.
  Even though your programmer gives you a file management system that is functional in a tool-like way, the weird way the human is forced to act in order to use the tool creates an unnecessary distance between the action the human is required to perform and the tool's function.
