City of God
Brazil, 1960s, City of God. The Tender Trio robs motels and gas trucks. Younger kids watch and learn well...too well. 1970s: Li'l Zé has prospered very well and owns the city. He causes violence and fear as he wipes out rival gangs without mercy. His best friend Bené is the only one to keep him on the good side of sanity. Rocket has watched these two gain power for years, and he wants no part of it. Yet he keeps getting swept up in the madness. All he wants to do is take pictures. 1980s: Things are out of control between the last two remaining gangs...will it ever end? Welcome to the City of God. During their childhood, several children raised in one of the violent neighborhoods of Rio de Janeiro see galling and nettlesome behaviors that turn some into criminals and some into poltroons; while one photographer boy in the middle stays out of their informal war until it's finished and then narrates the complicated story of what happened in that neighborhood and the ascending process of crime between men who were once innocent children.
