Once Upon a Time in the West
A mysterious stranger with a harmonica joins forces with a notorious desperado to protect a beautiful widow from a ruthless assassin working for the railroad.
Story of a young woman, Mrs. McBain, who moves from New Orleans to frontier Utah, on the very edge of the American West. She arrives to find her new husband and family slaughtered, but by whom? The prime suspect, coffee-lover Cheyenne, befriends her and offers to go after the real killer, assassin gang leader Frank, in her honor. He is accompanied by Harmonica, a man already on a quest to get even. The beautiful Jill McBain, married in New Orleans a month ago, arrives at her new husband's place to find him and his children dead. Also new to the area, a man known only as Harmonica (met by three gunmen whom he soon dispatches). All of the men, those at the McBains and the train depot, wore long coats, a trademark of local bandit Cheyenne and his gang, but it's Frank, who works for a railroad baron, who wants McBain's land and is trying to frame Cheyenne for the killing. Harmonica has his own reasons for seeking Frank, leading to a showdown.
